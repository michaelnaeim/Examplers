Given that there are 72 classrooms and 111 students in total, we can calculate the average number of students per classroom by dividing the total number of students by the number of classrooms:  $111 \text{ students} / 72 \text{ classrooms} \approx 1.54 \text{ students per classroom}$  Since we cannot have a fraction of a student, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure that all students can be accommodated. Therefore, each classroom will have 2 students except for some classrooms that will have 3 students.  Now, we need to calculate the total number of students that will occupy 2 seats and the total number of students that will occupy 3 seats.  Number of students occupying 2 seats: $72 \text{ classrooms} \times 2 \text{ students per classroom} = 144 \text{ students}$  Number of students occupying 3 seats: $111 \text{ total students} - 144 \text{ students} = 111 - 144 = -33 \text{ students}$  Since we cannot have a negative number of students, it means all students will occupy 2 seats.   To find out how many buses are needed, we divide the total number of students by the number of seats on each bus:  $111 \text{ students} / 3 \text{ seats per bus} = 37 \text{ buses}$  Therefore, 37 buses are needed to take the field trip.  #37",37.0,37.0
