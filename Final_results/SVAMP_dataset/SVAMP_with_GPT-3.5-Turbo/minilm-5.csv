We are given that there are 65 baskets in total, and each basket has 7 red peaches and 3 green peaches. Therefore, we have the following system of equations:  $r + g = 10$ (since each basket has a total of 10 peaches) $65r = 7 \times 65$ (total number of red peaches in all baskets) $65g = 3 \times 65$ (total number of green peaches in all baskets)  Solving the first equation for $r$, we get $r = 10 - g$. Substituting this into the second equation, we have:  $65(10 - g) = 7 \times 65$  Solving for $g$:  $650 - 65g = 455$  $-65g = -195$  $g = 3$  Substitute $g = 3$ back into $r = 10 - g$:  $r = 10 - 3$  $r = 7$  Therefore, each basket has 7 red peaches and 3 green peaches.  # $7$",,7.0

3 birds and 4 storks were sitting on the fence. 6 more storks came to join them. How many birds and storks are sitting on the fence?,13,"Let's denote the number of birds as $b$ and the number of storks as $s$.  From the information given, we have the following two equations: 1. $b + s = 3 + 4$ (initially, there were 3 birds and 4 storks on the fence) 2. $b + s + 6 = 3 + 4 + 6$ (after 6 more storks joined them)  Solving these equations simultaneously, we get: $b + s = 7$ $b + s + 6 = 13$  Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get: $6 = 13 - 7$ $6 = 6$  Therefore, there are 7 birds and 6 + 4 = 10 storks sitting on the fence.  # 7 birds and 10 storks are sitting on the fence.",,10.0
He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 16 sacks per day and that each sack containes 57 oranges. How many days will it take to harvest 80 sacks of oranges?,5,"To find out how many days it will take to harvest 80 sacks of oranges, we first need to calculate the total number of oranges in 80 sacks.  Since each sack contains 57 oranges, the total number of oranges in 80 sacks is: $57 \text{ oranges/sack} \times 80 \text{ sacks} = 4560 \text{ oranges}$  Now, we know that they harvest 16 sacks per day. To find out how many days it will take to harvest 80 sacks, we divide the total number of sacks by the number of sacks harvested per day: $80 \text{ sacks} \div 16 \text{ sacks/day} = 5 \text{ days}$  Therefore, it will take 5 days to harvest 80 sacks of oranges.  # 5",,5.0

A mailman has to give 32 pieces of junk mail to each of the 55 blocks. If he gives 8 mails to each house in a block How many houses are there in a block?,4,"Let's denote the number of houses in a block as $x$.   The mailman has to give 32 pieces of junk mail to each of the 55 blocks, so the total number of pieces of junk mail is $32 \times 55 = 1760$.  If he gives 8 mails to each house in a block, then the total number of houses in all blocks is $55 \times x$.   Since the total number of pieces of junk mail is equal to the total number of houses times the number of mails per house, we have the equation:  $1760 = 8 \times 55 \times x$  Solving for $x$:  $1760 = 440x$  $x = \frac{1760}{440} = 4$  Therefore, there are 4 houses in a block.  # 4",,4.0

There were 6 roses and 20 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 21 orchids and 22 roses in the vase. How many more roses than orchids are there in the vase now?,1,"Let's denote the number of roses Jessica cut from her garden as $x$ and the number of orchids as $y$.  Initially, there were 6 roses and 20 orchids in the vase, so the total number of flowers was $6 + 20 = 26$.  After Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her garden, the total number of flowers in the vase became $21 + 22 = 43$.  So, we have the following system of equations: 1. $6 + x = 22$ (the number of roses after Jessica cut some from her garden) 2. $20 + y = 21$ (the number of orchids after Jessica cut some from her garden) 3. $x + y = 43 - 26$ (the total number of flowers in the vase after Jessica cut some from her garden)  Solving the system of equations: 1. $x = 22 - 6 = 16$ 2. $y = 21 - 20 = 1$ 3. $x + y = 43 - 26 = 17$  Therefore, there are 16 more roses than orchids in the vase now.  # 16",,16.0

Brenda's mother made cookies for 10 guests but 9 guests did not come. If she prepared 18 cookies and each guest had the same number of cookies How many did each of them have?,18,"Let's denote the number of cookies each guest had as $x$. Since Brenda's mother made 18 cookies for 10 guests, we have the equation $10x = 18$. However, since only 1 guest came, we need to adjust the equation to account for the fact that 9 guests did not come. Therefore, we have $1x = 18$.  Solving for $x$: $10x = 18$   $x = \frac{18}{10}$   $x = 1.8$  Therefore, each guest had 1.8 cookies.  # $1.8$",,1.8
Rebecca wants to split a collection of eggs into groups of 3. Rebecca has 99 bananas 9 eggs and 27 marbles.

Zachary did 59 push-ups and 44 crunches in gym class today. David did 19 more push-ups but 27 less crunches than zachary. How many push-ups did David do?,78,"Let's denote the number of push-ups Zachary did as $Z$ and the number of push-ups David did as $D$. We are given that Zachary did 59 push-ups, so $Z = 59$.  We are also given that David did 19 more push-ups than Zachary, so $D = Z + 19$.  Now, we are given that David did 27 less crunches than Zachary. Let's denote the number of crunches Zachary did as $C$ and the number of crunches David did as $E$. We know that $C = 44$ and $E = C - 27$.  Since the number of push-ups is not related to the number of crunches, we can write an equation relating the number of push-ups done by David and Zachary: $D = Z + 19$.  Substitute the values of $Z$ and $D$: $59 + 19 = D$, $D = 78$.  Therefore, David did 78 push-ups.  #78",,78.0

Paul got a box of 521 crayons and 66 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 154 left while not having lost a single erasers. How many crayons had been lost or given away?,367,"Let's denote the number of crayons lost or given away as $x$.   Paul started with 521 crayons and ended with 154 crayons, so the number of crayons lost or given away is $521 - 154 = 367$.  Since Paul did not lose any erasers, the number of erasers he has at the end of the school year is the same as the number he started with, which is 66.  Therefore, the total number of items (crayons and erasers) at the beginning was $521 + 66 = 587$.  At the end of the school year, the total number of items left is $154 + 66 = 220$.  The total number of items lost or given away is the difference between the total number of items at the beginning and the total number of items at the end of the school year, which is $587 - 220 = 367$.  Therefore, the number of crayons lost or given away is $\boxed{367}$.   #367",,367.0

Since there are 20 books in total and you have not read 5 of them, the number of books you have read can be calculated as:  $x = 20 - 5$  $x = 15$  Therefore, you have already read $\boxed{15}$ books.  # 15",,15.0
"The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 24 inches. The frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 5 inches lesser than the frog. How much farther did the mouse jump than the grasshopper?",28,"Let's first find out how far the frog and the mouse jumped.  The frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper, so its jump was $24 + 33 = 57$ inches.  The mouse jumped 5 inches lesser than the frog, so its jump was $57 - 5 = 52$ inches.  To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we subtract the grasshopper's jump from the mouse's jump: $52 - 24 = 28$ inches.  Therefore, the mouse jumped 28 inches farther than the grasshopper.  # 28",,28.0
Haley grew 13 trees in her backyard. After a typhoon 6 died.

Haley grew 13 trees in her backyard. After the typhoon, 6 trees died.  Number of trees that survived = Total trees - Trees that died Number of trees that survived = 13 - 6 Number of trees that survived = 7  Now, to find out how many more trees survived than those that died: Number of trees that survived - Number of trees that died 7 - 6 = 1  Therefore, 1 more tree survived the typhoon than those that died.  # 1",,1.0
There are 8 different books and 10 different movies in the ' crazy silly school ' series. If you read 19 of the books and watched 61 of the movies How many more movies than books are there in the ' crazy silly school ' series?,2,"Let's denote the number of books as $B$ and the number of movies as $M$. We are given that $B = 8$ and $M = 10$.  We are also given that you read 19 books and watched 61 movies. Therefore, the difference between the number of movies and books you consumed is $61 - 19 = 42$.  To find out how many more movies than books there are in the series, we need to calculate $M - B$.  $M - B = 10 - 8 = 2$.

Faye was placing her pencils into rows with 22 pencils in each row. She had 6 packs of pencils each one having 14 pencils. How many pencils does she have?,84,"To find out how many pencils Faye has, we first need to calculate the total number of pencils in the packs.   Each pack has 14 pencils, and Faye has 6 packs, so the total number of pencils in the packs is: $14 \text{ pencils/pack} \times 6 \text{ packs} = 84$ pencils.  Next, we need to add the pencils in the packs to the pencils she placed in rows. Faye placed the pencils in rows with 22 pencils in each row. To find out how many pencils she placed in rows, we multiply the number of rows by the number of pencils in each row: $22 \text{ pencils/row} \times \text{number of rows}$.  Since we don't know the number of rows, we can represent it as $x$. Therefore, the total number of pencils Faye has is: $84 \text{ pencils (packs)} + 22x \text{ pencils (rows)}$.  Since we know that the total number of pencils is the same whether we count them by packs or by rows, we can set up an equation: $84 + 22x = \text{total number of pencils}$.  Given that Faye has 6 packs of pencils, we can substitute this information into the equation: $84 + 22x = 6 \times 14$.  Solving for $x$: $84 + 22x = 84$, $22x = 84 - 84$, $22x = 0$, $x = 0$.  Therefore, the total number of pencils Faye has is: $84 \text{ pencils (packs)} + 22 \times 0 \text{ pencils (rows)} = 84$ pencils.  # 84",,84.0

Jack received 3 emails and 64 letters in the morning. He then received 5 emails and 54 letters in the afternoon. How many emails did jack receive in the day?,8,"Let's denote the number of emails Jack received in the morning as $E_{\text{morning}}$ and in the afternoon as $E_{\text{afternoon}}$. Similarly, let's denote the number of letters Jack received in the morning as $L_{\text{morning}}$ and in the afternoon as $L_{\text{afternoon}}$.  Given: $E_{\text{morning}} = 3$ $L_{\text{morning}} = 64$ $E_{\text{afternoon}} = 5$ $L_{\text{afternoon}} = 54$  To find the total number of emails Jack received in the day, we need to sum the number of emails he received in the morning and in the afternoon.  Total number of emails $= E_{\text{morning}} + E_{\text{afternoon}}$  Substitute the given values: Total number of emails $= 3 + 5$  Therefore,  # Total number of emails $= 8$",,8.0
Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost some of his marbles at the playground. Now Ed has 19 more marbles than doug. How many marbles did Doug lose?,17,"Let's denote the number of marbles Doug had as $x$. Since Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug, Ed had $x+2$ marbles.  After Doug lost some marbles, let's say he lost $y$ marbles. So, Doug now has $x-y$ marbles.  Given that Ed now has 19 more marbles than Doug, we have the equation: $x+2 = (x-y) + 19$.  Expanding this equation, we get: $x+2 = x - y + 19$.  Rearranging terms, we get: $y = 21$.  Therefore, Doug lost 21 marbles.  #  21",,21.0

Jake has 13 fewer peaches and 3 more apples than Steven. Steven has 9 peaches and 8 apples. How many apples does Jake have?,11,"Let's first find out how many apples Jake has.  Since Steven has 8 apples, Jake has 8 + 3 = 11 apples.  Now, let's find out how many peaches Jake has.  Since Jake has 13 fewer peaches than Steven, and Steven has 9 peaches, Jake has 9 - 13 = -4 peaches.  However, it doesn't make sense for Jake to have negative peaches, so there seems to be an error in the question. Let's correct it by assuming that Jake actually has 13 more peaches than Steven.  Now, let's find out how many peaches Jake has.  Since Jake has 13 more peaches than Steven, and Steven has 9 peaches, Jake has 9 + 13 = 22 peaches.  Therefore, Jake has 11 apples.   # 11",,11.0
