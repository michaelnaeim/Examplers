Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Together they collected strawberries that weighed 22 pounds. On the way back Marco ' dad found 30 more pounds of strawberries. Marco's strawberries now weighed 36 pounds. How much did his dad's strawberries weigh now?,16,"Let's denote the weight of the strawberries Marco collected as $x$ pounds and the weight of the strawberries his dad collected as $y$ pounds.  From the information given in the question, we have the following system of equations: 1. $x + y = 22$ (the total weight of strawberries collected by Marco and his dad is 22 pounds) 2. $x + 30 = 36$ (after his dad found 30 more pounds of strawberries, Marco's strawberries weighed 36 pounds)  From equation 1, we can solve for $x$: $x = 22 - y$  Substitute this into equation 2: $22 - y + 30 = 36$  Solving for $y$: $52 - y = 36$  $y = 52 - 36$  $y = 16$  Therefore, Marco's dad's strawberries weighed 16 pounds.  # 16",,16

Therefore, we can write the following proportion: $\frac{t_1}{x} = \frac{t_2}{y}$  From the above proportion, we can rewrite it as: $t_1 = \frac{x}{y}t_2$  Substitute this into the equation $t_1 + t_2 = 38$: $\frac{x}{y}t_2 + t_2 = 38$ $(1 + \frac{x}{y})t_2 = 38$ $\frac{x+y}{y}t_2 = 38$ $\frac{19}{y}t_2 = 38$ $t_2 = \frac{38y}{19}$  Substitute this back into the equation $x + y = 18$: $x + \frac{38y}{19} = 18$ $x = 18 - \frac{38y}{19}$ $x = \frac{342 - 38y}{19}$  Now, we need to find the difference between the number of kids she played with on Monday and Tuesday: $x - y = \frac{342 - 38y}{19} - y$ $x - y = \frac{342 - 38y - 19y}{19}$ $x - y = \frac{342 - 57y}{19}$  Since $x - y$ represents the difference between the number of kids she played with on Monday and Tuesday, we need to find a value of $y$ that makes this difference an integer.  Let's try different values of $y$ starting from 1 and find the corresponding value of $x$: For $y = 1$, $x - 1 = \frac{342 - 57}{19} = \frac{285}{19} = 15$ For $y = 2$, $x - 2 = \frac{342 - 114}{19} = \frac{228}{19}$ (not an integer) For $y = 3$, $x - 3 = \frac{342 - 171}{19} = \frac{171}{19}$ (not an integer) For $y = 4$, $x - 4 = \frac{342 - 228}{19} = \frac{114}{19}$ (not an integer) For $y = 5$, $x - 5 = \frac{342 - 285}{19} = \frac{57}{19} = 3$  Therefore, Julia played with 3 more kids on Monday than on Tuesday.  # 3",,3
3 birds and 4 storks were sitting on the fence. 6 more storks came to join them. How many birds and storks are sitting on the fence?,13,"Let's denote the number of birds as $b$ and the number of storks as $s$.  From the information given, we have the following two equations: 1. $b + s = 3 + 4$ (initially, there were 3 birds and 4 storks) 2. $b + s + 6 = 3 + 4 + 6$ (after 6 more storks joined)  Solving these equations simultaneously, we get: 1. $b + s = 7$ 2. $b + s + 6 = 13$  Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get: $6 = 13 - 7$ $6 = 6$  This means our equations are consistent and the solution is unique.  Therefore, there are 7 birds and storks sitting on the fence.  # 7",,7
He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 16 sacks per day and that each sack containes 57 oranges. How many days will it take to harvest 80 sacks of oranges?,5,"To find out how many days it will take to harvest 80 sacks of oranges, we first need to calculate the total number of oranges in 80 sacks.  Since each sack contains 57 oranges, the total number of oranges in 80 sacks is: $57 \text{ oranges/sack} \times 80 \text{ sacks} = 4560 \text{ oranges}$  Now, we know that they harvest 16 sacks per day. To find out how many days it will take to harvest 80 sacks, we divide the total number of sacks by the number of sacks harvested per day: $80 \text{ sacks} \div 16 \text{ sacks/day} = 5 \text{ days}$  Therefore, it will take 5 days to harvest 80 sacks of oranges.  # 5",,5

Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends. If he had 13 crackers and 15 cakes initially How many crackers and cakes did each person eat?,1,"Let's denote the number of crackers and cakes each person received as $x$. Since Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to each of his 28 friends, we have the following equations:  $13 = 28x$ (total number of crackers) $15 = 28x$ (total number of cakes)  Solving for $x$:  $x = \frac{13}{28} = \frac{15}{28} = \frac{13+15}{28} = \frac{28}{28} = 1$  Therefore, each person received 1 cracker and 1 cake.  Each person ate: 1 cracker (initially 13 crackers, so 13 - 1 = 12 crackers left) 1 cake (initially 15 cakes, so 15 - 1 = 14 cakes left)  So, each person ate 1 cracker and 1 cake.  # Each person ate 1 cracker and 1 cake.",,1

We are told that she now has 55 Ace cards and 178 baseball cards left, so we can write the following equations:  $55$ Ace cards $= 18$ Ace cards $- x$  $178$ baseball cards $= 438$ baseball cards $- x$  Solving these equations, we find:  $x = 18 - 55 = -37$ (Nell gave Jeff 37 Ace cards)  $x = 438 - 178 = 260$ (Nell gave Jeff 260 baseball cards)  Now, let's calculate how many more baseball cards than Ace cards Nell has:  Nell has $178$ baseball cards and $55$ Ace cards left, so the difference is:  $178 - 55 = 123$  Therefore, Nell has 123 more baseball cards than Ace cards.  #123",,123
There were 15 roses in the vase. Jessica threw away 33 roses from the vase and cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. There are now 17 roses in the vase. How many more roses did she cut than those she threw away?,2,"Let's denote the number of roses Jessica cut from her garden as $x$.   Initially, there were 15 roses in the vase. Jessica then threw away 33 roses, leaving $15 - 33 = -18$ roses in the vase. This means that Jessica cut $17 - (-18) = 17 + 18 = 35$ roses from her garden to put in the vase.  To find how many more roses Jessica cut than those she threw away, we calculate $x - 33 = 35$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 35 + 33 = 68$.  Therefore, Jessica cut $68$ roses from her garden, which is $68 - 33 = 35$ more roses than she threw away.  # 35",,35

There were 6 roses and 20 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 21 orchids and 22 roses in the vase. How many more roses than orchids are there in the vase now?,1,"Let's denote the number of roses Jessica cut from her garden as $x$ and the number of orchids as $y$.  Initially, there were 6 roses and 20 orchids in the vase, so the total number of flowers was $6 + 20 = 26$.  After Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her garden, the total number of flowers in the vase became $21 + 22 = 43$.  So, we have the following system of equations: 1. $6 + x = 22$ (the number of roses after Jessica cut some from her garden) 2. $20 + y = 21$ (the number of orchids after Jessica cut some from her garden) 3. $x + y = 43 - 26$ (the total number of flowers in the vase after Jessica cut some from her garden)  Solving the system of equations: 1. $x = 22 - 6 = 16$ 2. $y = 21 - 20 = 1$ 3. $x + y = 43 - 26 = 17$  Therefore, there are 16 more roses than orchids in the vase now.  # 16",,16

Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour 8 cups of sugar and 7 cups of salt. She already put in 5 cups of flour. How many more cups of sugar than cups of salt does she need to add now?,1,"Mary needs to add 6 cups of flour, 8 cups of sugar, and 7 cups of salt to complete the recipe. She has already added 5 cups of flour, so she still needs to add 6 - 5 = 1 cup of flour.  To find out how many more cups of sugar than cups of salt she needs to add, we first calculate how many cups of sugar she needs to add: 8 cups of sugar (total needed) - 0 cups of sugar (already added) = 8 cups of sugar needed to add.  Next, we calculate how many cups of salt she needs to add: 7 cups of salt (total needed) - 0 cups of salt (already added) = 7 cups of salt needed to add.  Now, we find the difference between the cups of sugar needed and the cups of salt needed: 8 cups of sugar needed - 7 cups of salt needed = 1 cup more sugar than salt needed.  Therefore, Mary needs to add 1 more cup of sugar than cups of salt.   # 1",,1

There were 16 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 7 orchids and 13 roses in the vase. How many orchids did she cut?,4,"Let's denote the number of roses Jessica cut as $x$ and the number of orchids she cut as $y$.  Initially, there were 16 roses and 3 orchids in the vase, so the total number of flowers was $16 + 3 = 19$.  After cutting some roses and orchids, there are now 7 orchids and 13 roses in the vase, so the total number of flowers is $7 + 13 = 20$.  Since the total number of flowers remains the same, we can write the equation: $16 - x + 13 = 3 - y + 7$  Simplifying the equation, we get: $29 - x = 10 - y$  Now, we can solve for $y$: $y = 10 - (29 - x)$ $y = 10 - 29 + x$ $y = x - 19$  Therefore, Jessica cut 19 orchids.   #  # 19",,19
