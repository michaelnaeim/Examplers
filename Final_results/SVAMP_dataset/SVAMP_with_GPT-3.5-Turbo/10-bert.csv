Initially, there were 6 roses and 20 orchids in the vase, so the total number of flowers was \( 6 + 20 = 26 \).  After cutting some more roses and orchids, there are now 22 roses and 21 orchids in the vase, so the total number of flowers is \( 22 + 21 = 43 \).  Since the total number of flowers increased by \( 43 - 26 = 17 \) after Jessica cut more flowers, we have:  \[ r + o = 17 \]  We also know that the difference between the number of roses and orchids increased by 1, so:  \[ r - o = 1 \]  Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of \( r \) and \( o \):  Adding the two equations, we get:  \[ (r + o) + (r - o) = 17 + 1 \] \[ 2r = 18 \] \[ r = 9 \]  Substitute the value of \( r \) back into one of the equations to find \( o \):  \[ 9 - o = 1 \] \[ o = 8 \]  Therefore, Jessica cut 9 roses and 8 orchids from her garden. The number of roses in the vase now is \( 22 \) and the number of orchids is \( 21 \). The difference between the number of roses and orchids now is \( 22 - 21 = 1 \).

Faye was placing her pencils into rows with 22 pencils in each row. She had 6 packs of pencils each one having 14 pencils. How many pencils does she have?,84,"To find out how many pencils Faye has, we first need to calculate the total number of pencils in the packs she has.   Each pack has 14 pencils, and she has 6 packs, so the total number of pencils in the packs is: 14 pencils/pack * 6 packs = 84 pencils  Now, we need to add the pencils she has already placed in rows. She has 22 pencils in each row, and we don't know how many rows she has, so let's represent the number of rows as 'r'. The total number of pencils in the rows is: 22 pencils/row * r rows = 22r pencils  To find the total number of pencils Faye has, we need to add the pencils in the packs to the pencils in the rows: Total number of pencils = 84 pencils (from packs) + 22r pencils (from rows)  Since we know that the total number of pencils is the same as the number of pencils in each row times the number of rows, we can set up an equation: Total number of pencils = 22 pencils/row * r rows  Equating the two expressions for the total number of pencils, we get: 84 + 22r = 22r  Solving for 'r', we find: 84 = 22r r = 84/22 r = 3.818181...  Since the number of rows must be a whole number, we can see that Faye has 4 rows of pencils.   Now, we can find the total number of pencils she has by substituting 'r = 4' into the equation: Total number of pencils = 84 pencils (from packs) + 22 pencils/row * 4 rows Total number of pencils = 84 + 22 * 4 Total number of pencils = 84 + 88 Total number of pencils = 172  Therefore, Faye has a total of 172 pencils.",,172
