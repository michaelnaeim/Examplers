A farmer had 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes in his garden. If he picked 172 potatoes How many tomatoes and potatoes does he have left?,80,"Let's calculate the number of tomatoes and potatoes the farmer has left after picking 172 potatoes.  Initially, the farmer had 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes. After picking 172 potatoes, he will have 77 - 172 = -95 potatoes left. This negative value doesn't make sense, so let's correct the calculation.  The correct calculation should be: 77 (initial potatoes) - 172 (picked potatoes) = -95 (potatoes left)  Since the farmer cannot have a negative number of potatoes, it means he picked more potatoes than he had initially. Let's correct this by considering the total number of vegetables (tomatoes and potatoes) the farmer had initially.  Total vegetables initially = 175 tomatoes + 77 potatoes = 252 vegetables  After picking 172 potatoes, the number of tomatoes and potatoes left will be: 175 tomatoes + (77 potatoes - 172 picked potatoes) = 175 tomatoes + 77 - 172 = 175 tomatoes - 95 potatoes  Therefore, the farmer will have 175 tomatoes and 77 - 95 = -18 potatoes left. Again, a negative number of potatoes is not possible, so let's correct this.  Let's recalculate the number of tomatoes and potatoes the farmer has left: 175 tomatoes - 172 picked potatoes = 175 tomatoes - 172 = 3 tomatoes 77 potatoes - 172 picked potatoes = 77 - 172 = -95 potatoes  The correct calculation shows that the farmer has 3 tomatoes and -95 potatoes left. Since the farmer cannot have a negative number of potatoes, it means he picked more potatoes than he had initially.  So, the farmer has 3 tomatoes left and 0 potatoes left.  # 3 tomatoes # 0 potatoes",,0

"After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 705 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?",57,"Let's calculate the total number of visitors in the previous 2 days first: Previous day: 191 visitors Day before that: 457 visitors  Total visitors in the previous 2 days = 191 + 457 = 648 visitors  Now, we can find the difference in the number of visitors on the day Rachel visited and the previous 2 days: Difference = 705 (visitors on Rachel's day) - 648 (visitors in the previous 2 days) = 57  Therefore, there were 57 more visitors on the day Rachel visited compared to the previous 2 days.  # 57",,57
There are 11 different books and 17 different movies in the ' crazy silly school ' series. If you read 7 of the books and watched 21 of the movies How many more movies than books have you read?,14,"To find out how many more movies than books have been read, we first calculate the difference between the number of movies and books that have been read.  Number of books read = 7 Number of movies watched = 21  Number of movies read - Number of books read = 21 - 7 = 14  Therefore, you have read 14 more movies than books.  # 14",,14
For the walls of the house he would use 12 large planks of wood and 10 small planks. If large planks together need 15 pieces of nails to be secured and small planks together need 5 nails. How many nails does John need for the house wall?,20,"Let's first calculate the total number of nails needed for the large planks. Since each large plank needs 15 nails, and John has 12 large planks, the total number of nails needed for the large planks is 15 nails/plank * 12 planks = 180 nails.  Next, let's calculate the total number of nails needed for the small planks. Since each small plank needs 5 nails, and John has 10 small planks, the total number of nails needed for the small planks is 5 nails/plank * 10 planks = 50 nails.  Therefore, the total number of nails John needs for the house wall is 180 nails for the large planks + 50 nails for the small planks = 230 nails.  # 230",,230
Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends. If he had 13 crackers and 15 cakes initially How many crackers and cakes did each person eat?,1,"Let's denote the number of crackers and cakes each person ate as \( x \).  Matthew gave each of his 28 friends \( x \) crackers and \( x \) cakes. So, the total number of crackers and cakes given out is \( 28x + 28x = 56x \).  We know that initially there were 13 crackers and 15 cakes, so the total number of items is 13 + 15 = 28.  Since each person received an equal number of crackers and cakes, we have the equation:  \[ 56x = 28 \]  Solving for \( x \):  \[ x = \frac{28}{56} = \frac{1}{2} \]  Each person ate \( \frac{1}{2} \) crackers and \( \frac{1}{2} \) cakes.  # Each person ate 0.5 crackers and 0.5 cakes.",,0.5

Given: - 92 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the day Rachel visited. - 419 visitors came to the Buckingham palace the day before Rachel visited. - 103 visitors came to the Buckingham palace two days before Rachel visited.  We know that the total number of visitors is the sum of visitors on all days: \[ x + 103 + 419 + 92 = x + 614 = \text{Total number of visitors}\]  Since the total number of visitors is the sum of visitors on all days, we can set up the equation: \[x + 614 = 92 + 419 + 103\]  Solving for $x$: \[x = 92 + 419 + 103 - 614\] \[x = 614 - 614\] \[x = 0\]  Therefore, there were 0 visitors who visited the Buckingham palace before the day with 103 visitors.  # $0$",,0
