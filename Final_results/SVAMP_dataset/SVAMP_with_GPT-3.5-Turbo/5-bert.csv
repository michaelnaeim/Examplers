Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Together they collected strawberries that weighed 22 pounds. On the way back Marco ' dad found 30 more pounds of strawberries. Marco's strawberries now weighed 36 pounds. How much did his dad's strawberries weigh now?,16,"Let's denote the weight of Marco's strawberries as \( x \) pounds and the weight of his dad's strawberries as \( y \) pounds.  From the information given, we have the following equations:  1. \( x + y = 22 \) (initial weight of strawberries collected together) 2. \( y + 30 = 36 \) (weight of strawberries after his dad found 30 more pounds)  From equation 1, we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \) as \( y = 22 - x \).  Substitute this expression for \( y \) into equation 2:  \( 22 - x + 30 = 36 \)  Solving for \( x \):  \( 52 - x = 36 \)  \( x = 52 - 36 \)  \( x = 16 \)  Now, substitute \( x = 16 \) back into equation 1 to find \( y \):  \( 16 + y = 22 \)  \( y = 22 - 16 \)  \( y = 6 \)  Therefore, Marco's strawberries weighed 16 pounds and his dad's strawberries weighed 6 pounds after finding 30 more pounds.",,30

Since David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary, we can set up the equation:  David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 56  Given that David did 38 push-ups, we can substitute this into the equation:  38 = Zachary's push-ups + 56  Subtracting 56 from both sides gives:  Zachary's push-ups = 38 - 56 Zachary's push-ups = -18  Since the number of push-ups can't be negative, there seems to be an error in the information provided. If we assume that Zachary did 18 push-ups (which would make the total number of push-ups positive), then the total number of push-ups done by Zachary and David together would be:  Total push-ups = David's push-ups + Zachary's push-ups Total push-ups = 38 + 18 Total push-ups = 56  Therefore, Zachary and David did 56 push-ups altogether.",,56

She has 22 pencils in each row, and we don't know how many rows she has, so let's represent the number of rows as 'r'. The total number of pencils in the rows is: 22 pencils/row * r rows = 22r pencils  To find the total number of pencils Faye has, we need to add the pencils in the packs to the pencils in the rows: Total number of pencils = 84 pencils (from packs) + 22r pencils (from rows)  Since we know that the total number of pencils is the same as the number of pencils in each row times the number of rows, we can set up an equation: 84 + 22r = 22r  Now, we can solve for 'r': 84 = 22r - 22r 84 = 0r r = 0  This means that Faye has not placed any pencils in rows yet, so the total number of pencils she has is just the number of pencils in the packs: Total number of pencils = 84 pencils  Therefore, Faye has 84 pencils in total.",,84

From the given information:
- Paul had 21 books initially.
- After selling some books, he bought 42 new ones.
- Finally, he has 15 books.

So, we can write the equation:
21 - x + y = 15

Also, we know that the number of books sold is more than the number bought:
x > y

Now, we can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of x and y.

From the first equation:
21 - x + y = 15
y - x = 15 - 21
y - x = -6

From the second equation:
x > y

Combining these two equations, we get:
y - x = -6
y < x

Therefore, the number of books Paul sold (x) is greater than the number of books he bought (y) by 6 books.",6.0,6.0

Since the book had 193 pages equally distributed over 15 chapters, each chapter would have 193/15 = 12.866... pages. Since we can't have a fraction of a chapter, we can assume each chapter has 13 pages.

Now, to find out how many chapters Frank read per day, we divide the total number of chapters by the number of days it took him to finish the book:

Total number of chapters = 193 pages / 13 pages per chapter = 15 chapters

Chapters read per day = 15 chapters / 660 days = 0.0227 chapters per day

Dan has $ 4. For a total of $ 3 he bought 10 candy bar each one costing the same amount of money.How much money is left?,#### 1.0,"Let's solve the last question:

Let the cost of each candy bar be x dollars.

Dan spent $3 to buy 10 candy bars, so the total cost of the candy bars is 10x dollars.

Since Dan has $4, the amount of money left after buying the candy bars is $4 - $3 = $1.

Therefore, we have the equation:
10x = $3
x = $3 / 10
x = $0.30

So, each candy bar costs $0.30.

Dan spent $3 to buy 10 candy bars, which is a total of $3 * 10 = $30. Since he had $4 initially, he has $4 - $3 = $1 left after buying the candy bars.",1.0,1.0

Given:
Number of crayons Paul had at the beginning = 617
Number of erasers Paul had at the beginning = 457
Number of crayons Paul had left at the end = 523

He found out that they harvest 16 sacks per day and that each sack containes 57 oranges.How many days will it take to harvest 80 sacks of oranges?,#### 5.0,"To find out how many days it will take to harvest 80 sacks of oranges, we can first calculate the total number of oranges harvested per day and then determine the number of days needed to reach the desired amount.

Given:
- 16 sacks are harvested per day
- Each sack contains 57 oranges

Total oranges harvested per day = 16 sacks/day * 57 oranges/sack = 912 oranges/day

To harvest 80 sacks of oranges, we need to calculate the total number of oranges needed:
Total oranges needed = 80 sacks * 57 oranges/sack = 4560 oranges

Now, we can determine the number of days needed to harvest 80 sacks of oranges:
Number of days = Total oranges needed / Total oranges harvested per day
Number of days = 4560 oranges / 912 oranges/day
Number of days = 5 days

Therefore, it will take 5 days to harvest 80 sacks of oranges at a rate of 16 sacks per day, with each sack containing 57 oranges.",5.0,57.0

Number of shirts made yesterday = 9
Number of shirts made today = 44
Total number of shirts made = 9 + 44 = 53

Since the machine can make 3 shirts per minute, we can calculate the number of minutes it worked yesterday:

Number of minutes = 9 / 3
Number of minutes = 3

Allan brought 5 balloons. If Allan and Jake brought total of 6 balloons to the parkHow many balloons did Jake bring to the park?,#### 1.0,"Let's denote the number of balloons Allan brought as A and the number of balloons Jake brought as J.

1. A + J = 3
   If Allan brought 2 balloons, then A = 2.
   Substituting A = 2 into the first equation:
   2 + J = 3
   J = 1
   Jake brought 1 balloon to the park.

2. A = 5
   J = A + 6 = 5 + 6 = 11
   Jake brought 11 balloons to the park.

3. J = 6
   J = A + 4
   6 = A + 4
   A = 2
   Allan brought 2 balloons to the park.

4. A = 2 + 3 = 5
   J = 6
   Jake had 6 - 5 = 1 more balloon than Allan in the park.

5. A = 5
   J = 6 - 4 = 2
   Allan brought 5 balloons to the park.

6. A = 5
   A + J = 6
   5 + J = 6
