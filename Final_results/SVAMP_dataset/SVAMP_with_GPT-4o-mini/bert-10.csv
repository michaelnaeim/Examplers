Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Together they collected strawberries that weighed 22 pounds. On the way back Marco ' dad found 30 more pounds of strawberries. Marco's strawberries now weighed 36 pounds. How much did his dad's strawberries weigh now?,16,"Let's break down the problem step by step.  1. Initially, Marco and his dad collected strawberries that weighed a total of 22 pounds. 2. On the way back, Marco's dad found an additional 30 pounds of strawberries. 3. After this, Marco's strawberries weighed 36 pounds.  Letâ€™s denote: - The initial weight of Marco's strawberries as \( M \). - The initial weight of his dad's strawberries as \( D \).  From the information given, we have the equation: \[ M + D = 22 \]  After finding the additional 30 pounds, the total weight of strawberries collected by Marco's dad becomes: \[ D + 30 \]  Now, we know that Marco's strawberries now weigh 36 pounds. This means that the weight of Marco's strawberries has increased from \( M \) to 36 pounds.   To find out how much his dad's strawberries weigh now, we need to find the initial weight of Marco's strawberries \( M \).   Since Marco's strawberries increased from \( M \) to 36 pounds, we can express this as: \[ M + x = 36 \] where \( x \) is the increase in weight of Marco's strawberries.  Now, we can substitute \( M \) from the first equation into the second equation.   From \( M + D = 22 \), we can express \( D \) as: \[ D = 22 - M \]  Now, we need to find \( M \). Since we know that Marco's strawberries increased to 36 pounds, we can find \( M \) by considering the total weight of strawberries collected.  Since Marco's dad found 30 more pounds, the total weight of strawberries collected by both of them now is: \[ 36 + (D + 30) \]  We can express \( D + 30 \) as: \[ D + 30 = (22 - M) + 30 = 52 - M \]  Now, we can set up the equation: \[ 36 + (52 - M) = 36 + 52 - M = 88 - M \]  However, we need to find \( D + 30 \) directly.   Since we know that Marco's strawberries increased to 36 pounds, we can find \( M \) by using the total weight: 1. Initially, they had 22 pounds. 2. Marco's dad found 30 more pounds, so the total weight is now: \[ 22 + 30 = 52 \]  Now, we know that Marco's strawberries weigh 36 pounds, so we can find the weight of his dad's strawberries: \[ D + 30 = 52 - 36 = 16 \]  Thus, the weight of Marco's dad's strawberries now is: \[ D + 30 = 16 \]  So, the final answer is: Marco's dad's strawberries now weigh **16 pounds**.",,16

Ed had 10 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost 11 of his marbles at the playground. If Ed had 45 marbles How many more marbles did Ed have than Doug then?,21,"Let's break down the problem step by step.  1. We know that Ed had 10 more marbles than Doug. Let's denote the number of marbles Doug had as \( D \). Therefore, we can express Ed's marbles as:    \[    E = D + 10    \]  2. We are given that Ed had 45 marbles:    \[    E = 45    \]  3. Substituting the value of \( E \) into the equation:    \[    45 = D + 10    \]  4. To find \( D \), we can solve for \( D \):    \[    D = 45 - 10 = 35    \]  5. So, Doug originally had 35 marbles. However, we are told that Doug lost 11 marbles:    \[    D_{\text{lost}} = 35 - 11 = 24    \]  6. Now, we need to find out how many more marbles Ed has than Doug after Doug lost his marbles. Ed still has 45 marbles, and Doug now has 24 marbles.  7. The difference in the number of marbles is:    \[    45 - 24 = 21    \]  Thus, Ed has 21 more marbles than Doug after Doug lost his marbles.",,21

Dave had 17 apps on his phone. After adding some he had 18 left. How many apps did he add?,1,"If Dave had 17 apps on his phone and after adding some he had 18 left, it means he must have removed some apps.   To find out how many apps he added, we can set up the equation:  Let \( x \) be the number of apps he added.   Initially, he had 17 apps. After adding \( x \) apps, he had \( 17 + x \) apps. However, he ended up with 18 apps.   So we can write the equation:  \[ 17 + x - y = 18 \]  where \( y \) is the number of apps he removed.   Since we don't have information about how many apps he removed, we can't determine how many he added based solely on the information given.   However, if we assume he didn't remove any apps, then he would have added 1 app to go from 17 to 18.   Thus, the answer is that he added 1 app, assuming he didn't remove any. If he did remove apps, we would need more information to determine the exact number he added.",,1

From the information given, we know the number of visitors for the last three days: - Day 1 (most recent): 705 visitors - Day 2: 191 visitors - Day 3: 457 visitors  Now, we need to find the total number of visitors for the previous 245 days. Since we only have the visitor counts for the last three days, we can assume that the visitor count for the previous 245 days is not provided.   However, if we assume that the average number of visitors for those 245 days is the same as the average of the last three days, we can calculate that average:  1. Calculate the total number of visitors for the last three days:    \[    705 + 191 + 457 = 1353    \]  2. Calculate the average number of visitors over these three days:    \[    \text{Average} = \frac{1353}{3} = 451    \]  3.

Jessica threw away 34 roses. After throwing away 34 roses, the number of roses left in the vase would be:    \[    21 - 34 = -13    \]    This means that if she only threw away 34 roses, there would be -13 roses, which is not possible. This indicates that she could not have thrown away all 34 roses because there weren't enough roses in the vase to begin with.  3. Since there are now 15 roses in the vase, we can determine how many roses she must have cut from her garden. Let \( x \) be the number of roses she cut from her garden. The equation representing the situation after throwing away some roses and adding new ones is:    \[    21 - y + x = 15    \]    where \( y \) is the number of roses she actually threw away.  4. Rearranging the equation gives:    \[    x - y = 15 - 21    \]    \[    x - y = -6    \]    This means:    \[    x = y - 6    \]  5. We know that she threw away 34 roses, but since she only had 21 roses, she could not have thrown away more than 21. Therefore, the maximum number of roses she could have thrown away is 21. Thus, we can set \( y = 21 \).  6. Substituting \( y = 21 \) into the equation \( x = y - 6 \):    \[    x = 21 - 6 = 15    \]  7. Now we can find how many more roses she threw away than those she cut from her garden:    \[    y - x = 21 - 15 = 6    \]  Thus, Jessica threw away 6 more roses than those she cut from her garden.",,6

Initially, the total number of fish Paige had was:  \[ G + C = 16 + 71 = 87 \]  After some fish were eaten by stray cats, Paige is left with 2 fish. Therefore, the number of fish that disappeared is:  \[ 87 - 2 = 85 \]  Now, we need to determine how many of the 85 fish that disappeared were goldfish. Since we don't have specific information about how many of each type of fish were eaten, we can only conclude that a total of 85 fish (both goldfish and catfish) disappeared.  However, if we assume that all the remaining fish are catfish (which is a possibility), then all 16 goldfish could have disappeared.   Thus, the number of goldfish that disappeared could be anywhere from 0 to 16, depending on how many of each type were eaten.   In summary, without additional information, we cannot determine the exact number of goldfish that disappeared, but it could be as many as 16.",,16

36 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 68 children got off the bus while some more got on the bus. Then there were 12 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got off the bus than those that got on?,24,"Let's break down the problem step by step.  1. Initially, there were 36 children on the bus. 2. At the bus stop, 68 children got off the bus. After these children got off, the number of children left on the bus would be:    \[    36 - 68 = -32    \]    This means that 68 children getting off the bus exceeds the number of children that were originally on the bus, resulting in a deficit of 32 children.  3. Let \( x \) be the number of children that got on the bus. After 68 children got off and \( x \) children got on, the total number of children on the bus is given as 12. Therefore, we can set up the equation:    \[    -32 + x = 12    \]  4. Solving for \( x \):    \[    x = 12 + 32 = 44    \]    So, 44 children got on the bus.  5. Now, we need to find out how many more children got off the bus than those that got on. The number of children that got off the bus is 68, and the number that got on is 44. The difference is:    \[    68 - 44 = 24    \]  Thus, 24 more children got off the bus than those that got on.   The final answer is: \[ \boxed{24} \]",,24

David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary in gym class today. If David did 38 push-ups How many push-ups did Zachary and David do altogether?,20,"Let's denote the number of push-ups Zachary did as \( Z \).  According to the problem, David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary. We can express this relationship as:  \[ D = Z + 56 \]  We know that David did 38 push-ups, so we can substitute \( D \) with 38:  \[ 38 = Z + 56 \]  To find \( Z \), we can rearrange the equation:  \[ Z = 38 - 56 \] \[ Z = -18 \]  Since the number of push-ups cannot be negative, it seems there is a contradiction in the problem statement. However, if we assume that David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary, and he did 38 push-ups, it implies that Zachary must have done a negative number of push-ups, which is not possible in this context.  If we ignore the contradiction and just calculate the total push-ups David and Zachary did together, we can still express it as:  \[ \text{Total} = D + Z = 38 + Z \]  Since \( Z \) is negative, the total would also be less than 38.   Thus, the conclusion is that the problem contains an inconsistency, and Zachary's push-ups cannot be determined as a valid non-negative number.",,38

"The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 24 inches. The frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 5 inches lesser than the frog. How much farther did the mouse jump than the grasshopper?",28,"Let's break down the jumps of each animal step by step.  1. The grasshopper jumped 24 inches. 2. The frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper. Therefore, the frog's jump is:    \[    24 + 33 = 57 \text{ inches}    \] 3. The mouse jumped 5 inches less than the frog. Therefore, the mouse's jump is:    \[    57 - 5 = 52 \text{ inches}    \]  Now, we need to find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper. We can calculate this by subtracting the grasshopper's jump from the mouse's jump: \[ 52 - 24 = 28 \text{ inches} \]  Thus, the mouse jumped 28 inches farther than the grasshopper.",,28
Haley grew 13 trees in her backyard. After a typhoon 6 died. How many more trees survived the typhoon than those that died?,1,"Haley initially grew 13 trees. After the typhoon, 6 trees died. To find out how many trees survived, we subtract the number of trees that died from the total number of trees:  Survived trees = Total trees - Died trees Survived trees = 13 - 6 = 7  Now, to find out how many more trees survived than those that died, we subtract the number of trees that died from the number of trees that survived:  More survived than died = Survived trees - Died trees More survived than died = 7 - 6 = 1  So, 1 more tree survived the typhoon than those that died.",,1

Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 5 cups of sugar and 13 cups of flour. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 12 more cups of flour How many cups of flour did she put in?,1,"To find out how many cups of flour Mary has already put in, we can set up the equation based on the information given.  The total amount of flour needed for the recipe is 13 cups. If she still needs 12 more cups of flour, we can express the amount of flour she has already put in as follows:  Let \( x \) be the amount of flour Mary has already put in. According to the problem, the amount of flour she still needs (12 cups) plus the amount she has already put in ( \( x \) cups) should equal the total amount needed (13 cups):  \[ x + 12 = 13 \]  Now, we can solve for \( x \):  \[ x = 13 - 12 \] \[ x = 1 \]  So, Mary has already put in **1 cup of flour**.",,1

Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost some of his marbles at the playground. Now Ed has 19 more marbles than doug. How many marbles did Doug lose?,17,"Let's denote the number of marbles Doug originally had as \( D \). According to the problem, Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug, so we can express the number of marbles Ed had as \( D + 2 \).  After Doug lost some marbles, let's say he lost \( x \) marbles. Therefore, the number of marbles Doug has now is \( D - x \).  According to the problem, after losing the marbles, Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug. We can express this relationship as:  \[ D + 2 = (D - x) + 19 \]  Now, we can simplify this equation:  \[ D + 2 = D - x + 19 \]  Subtract \( D \) from both sides:  \[ 2 = -x + 19 \]  Now, add \( x \) to both sides and subtract 2 from both sides:  \[ x = 19 - 2 \]  \[ x = 17 \]  Thus, Doug lost \( \boxed{17} \) marbles.",,17
