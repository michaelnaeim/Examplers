Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Together they collected strawberries that weighed 22 pounds. On the way back Marco ' dad found 30 more pounds of strawberries. Marco's strawberries now weighed 36 pounds. How much did his dad's strawberries weigh now?,16,"Let's break down the problem step by step.  1. Initially, Marco and his dad collected strawberries that weighed a total of 22 pounds. We can denote the weight of Marco's strawberries as \( M \) and the weight of his dad's strawberries as \( D \). Therefore, we have the equation:    \[    M + D = 22    \]  2. On the way back, Marco's dad found an additional 30 pounds of strawberries. This means the new weight of his dad's strawberries is:    \[    D + 30    \]  3. We are told that Marco's strawberries now weigh 36 pounds. This means that the weight of Marco's strawberries has increased from \( M \) to 36 pounds.   4. We need to find out how much his dad's strawberries weigh now. We can express the total weight of strawberries after the dad found more strawberries as:    \[    M + (D + 30) = 36 + (D + 30)    \]  5. Since we know that initially \( M + D = 22 \), we can substitute \( M \) with 36 in the equation:    \[    36 + D + 30 = 22 + 30    \]  6. Now, we can solve for \( D \):    \[    D + 30 = 36 - 22    \]    \[    D + 30 = 14    \]    \[    D = 14 - 30    \]    \[    D = -16    \]  This indicates that there was an error in the interpretation of the problem. Let's clarify:  - Initially, \( M + D = 22 \). - After finding 30 more pounds, the dad's strawberries become \( D + 30 \). - Marco's strawberries are now 36 pounds.  To find the dad's strawberries after the additional 30 pounds, we need to find the original weight of the dad's strawberries \( D \) first.  From the first equation, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( M \): \[ D = 22 - M \]  Now, since Marco's strawberries are now 36 pounds, we can substitute \( M = 36 \) into the equation: \[ D = 22 - 36 \] \[ D = -14 \]  This indicates that the initial weight of Marco's strawberries was less than what was collected, which is not possible.   Let's assume Marco's strawberries were initially \( M \) and his dad's strawberries were \( D \).   If Marco's strawberries are now 36 pounds, and they initially collected 22 pounds, we can conclude that: \[ M + D + 30 = 36 \] \[ M + D = 6 \]  This contradicts the initial total of 22 pounds.   Thus, we need to find the dad's strawberries after the additional 30 pounds: \[ D + 30 = 22 - M + 30 \]  Since Marco's strawberries are now 36 pounds, we can conclude: \[ D + 30 = 36 - M \]  To find the dad's strawberries after the additional 30 pounds, we can conclude: \[ D + 30 = 36 - (22 - D) \]  This leads us to: \[ D + 30 = 36 - 22 + D \] \[ D + 30 = 14 + D \]  Thus, the dad's strawberries now weigh: \[ D + 30 = 36 \]  So, the final weight of the dad's strawberries is: \[ D + 30 = 36 \]  Thus, the dad's strawberries now weigh: \[ D + 30 = 36 \]  Finally, the dad's strawberries weigh: # 36",,36
Debby bought 200 water bottles and 256 soda bottles when they were on sale.

Debby drinks 4 soda bottles per day.   Next, we need to find out how many soda bottles she has in total, which is given as 256 soda bottles.  Now, we can calculate the number of days the soda bottles will last by dividing the total number of soda bottles by the number of soda bottles she drinks per day:  \[ \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total soda bottles}}{\text{Soda bottles consumed per day}} = \frac{256}{4} \]  Calculating this gives:  \[ \frac{256}{4} = 64 \]  Thus, the soda bottles will last for 64 days.  # 64",,64
There were 106 dollars in Olivia's wallet. After she visited a supermarket and a showroom there were 26 dollars left. If she spent 49 dollars at the showroom How much did she spend at the supermarket?,31,"To find out how much Olivia spent at the supermarket, we can set up the problem using the information given.  1. **Initial Amount**: Olivia started with 106 dollars. 2. **Amount Left After Shopping**: After visiting both the supermarket and the showroom, she had 26 dollars left. 3. **Amount Spent at the Showroom**: She spent 49 dollars at the showroom.  Let's denote the amount Olivia spent at the supermarket as \( x \).  Now, we can set up the equation based on the total amount she had and the amounts spent:  \[ \text{Initial Amount} - \text{Amount Spent at Supermarket} - \text{Amount Spent at Showroom} = \text{Amount Left} \]  Substituting the known values into the equation:  \[ 106 - x - 49 = 26 \]  Now, we can simplify this equation:  1. Combine the constants on the left side:    \[    106 - 49 = 57    \]    So the equation becomes:    \[    57 - x = 26    \]  2. To isolate \( x \), subtract 57 from both sides:    \[    -x = 26 - 57    \]    \[    -x = -31    \]  3. Multiply both sides by -1 to solve for \( x \):    \[    x = 31    \]  Thus, Olivia spent 31 dollars at the supermarket.  The final answer is:  # 31",,31

Rebecca wants to split her collection of eggs into groups of 11. However, the problem states that each group has 2 eggs. This seems to be a misunderstanding because if each group has 2 eggs, then the grouping of 11 does not apply directly.  Let's clarify the situation:  1. If Rebecca is grouping her eggs into groups of 11, then each group should contain 11 eggs. 2. If we interpret the problem as asking how many eggs she has if she can form groups of 11, we can set up the equation based on the number of groups.  Let \( n \) be the number of groups of 11. Then the total number of eggs \( E \) can be expressed as: \[ E = 11n \]  However, if we consider the statement ""each group has 2 eggs,"" it seems to imply that she is actually forming groups of 2 eggs instead.   If we assume she is forming groups of 2 eggs, then the number of groups \( g \) can be expressed as: \[ g = \frac{E}{2} \]  To find the total number of eggs, we need to reconcile these two interpretations.   If we assume she can form groups of 11 and each group has 2 eggs, we can set up the following equation: \[ E = 11 \times 2 \] This means she can form 11 groups of 2 eggs each.  Calculating this gives: \[ E = 22 \]  Thus, Rebecca has a total of 22 eggs.  Therefore, the final answer is:  # 22",,22

There were 15 roses in the vase. Jessica threw away 33 roses from the vase and cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. There are now 17 roses in the vase. How many more roses did she cut than those she threw away?,2,"Let's break down the problem step by step.  1. **Initial Count of Roses**: Jessica starts with 15 roses in the vase.  2. **Roses Thrown Away**: Jessica throws away 33 roses. However, since she only had 15 roses to begin with, she cannot throw away more roses than she has. This means that the maximum number of roses she could throw away is 15. Therefore, we can conclude that she threw away all 15 roses.  3. **Roses Remaining After Throwing Away**: After throwing away 15 roses, the count of roses in the vase is:    \[    15 - 15 = 0    \]    So, there are 0 roses left in the vase after she throws them away.  4. **New Count of Roses**: After throwing away the roses, Jessica cuts some new roses from her garden and puts them in the vase. We know that the final count of roses in the vase is 17.  5. **Roses Cut**: Let \( x \) be the number of new roses Jessica cut from her garden. Since she had 0 roses left after throwing away the old ones, the equation for the total number of roses in the vase becomes:    \[    0 + x = 17    \]    Therefore, \( x = 17 \). Jessica cut 17 new roses.  6. **Roses Thrown Away**: We established that she threw away 15 roses.  7. **Difference in Roses Cut and Thrown Away**: We need to find out how many more roses she cut than those she threw away. This can be calculated as:    \[    x - 15 = 17 - 15 = 2    \]  Thus, Jessica cut 2 more roses than she threw away.  The final answer is:  # 2",,2

Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost some of his marbles at the playground. Now Ed has 19 more marbles than doug. How many marbles did Doug lose?,17,"Let the number of marbles Doug originally had be \( d \). According to the problem, Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug, so we can express the number of marbles Ed had as:  \[ e = d + 2 \]  After Doug lost some marbles, let’s denote the number of marbles he lost as \( x \). Therefore, the number of marbles Doug has now is:  \[ d - x \]  At this point, we know that Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug. This gives us the equation:  \[ e = (d - x) + 19 \]  Substituting the expression for \( e \) from the first equation into this equation, we have:  \[ d + 2 = (d - x) + 19 \]  Now, we can simplify this equation:  \[ d + 2 = d - x + 19 \]  Subtract \( d \) from both sides:  \[ 2 = -x + 19 \]  Now, isolate \( x \) by adding \( x \) to both sides and subtracting 2 from both sides:  \[ x = 19 - 2 \]  This simplifies to:  \[ x = 17 \]  Thus, Doug lost 17 marbles.
