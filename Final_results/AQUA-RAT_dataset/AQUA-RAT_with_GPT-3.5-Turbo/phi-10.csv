"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower.

After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? ['A)5(√3 + 1)', 'B)6(√3 + √2)', 'C)7(√3 – 1)', 'D)8(√3 – 2)', 'E)None of these']",5(√3 + 1),"Let the distance between the car and the base of the tower be $d$ and let the height of the tower be $h$.   When the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60°, the car has traveled a horizontal distance $x$ such that $\tan(60^\circ) = \frac{h}{d+x}$ and $\tan(45^\circ) = \frac{h}{d}$.   Solving these equations, we get $d = h(\sqrt{3} - 1)$ and $x = h(\sqrt{3} + 1)$.   The time taken to cover distance $x$ is 10 minutes.   Now, the total distance to be covered by the car to reach the base of the tower is $d$, which is $h(\sqrt{3} - 1)$.   Let the speed of the car be $v$ (in units per minute).   The time taken to cover this distance is $\frac{h(\sqrt{3} - 1)}{v}$.   Adding the initial 10 minutes, the total time taken by the car to reach the base of the tower is $\frac{h(\sqrt{3} - 1)}{v} + 10$.

So, the number of students studying math is $\frac{1}{16} \times 1000 = 62.5$, which we round up to 63. The number of students studying bio is $\frac{1}{10} \times 1000 = 100$. The number of students studying English is $\frac{1}{8} \times 1000 = 125$.  Therefore, the minimum number of students is $63 + 100 + 125 = 288$.  To find the maximum number of students, we assume that the number of students is the largest 4-digit number, which is 9999.  So, the number of students studying math is $\frac{1}{16} \times 9999 \approx 624.94$, which we round down to 624. The number of students studying bio is $\frac{1}{10} \times 9999 = 999.9$, which we round down to 999. The number of students studying English is $\frac{1}{8} \times 9999 = 1249.875$, which we round down to 1249.  Therefore, the maximum number of students is $624 + 999 + 1249 = 2872$.  The difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is $2872 - 288 = 2584$.  # Answer  2584",,2584.0
"On a normal day Bill usually averages about 15 mph when riding his bicycle. On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. How far can Bill travel on a windy day in 21 minutes?

On a normal day, Bill's speed is 15 mph. On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph, so his speed on a windy day is 15 mph - 4 mph = 11 mph.  Now, we need to convert 21 minutes to hours to match the speed unit. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 21 minutes is equal to 21/60 = 0.35 hours.  Distance = Speed x Time  Distance = 11 mph x 0.35 hours  Distance = 3.85 miles  Therefore, Bill can travel 3.85 miles on a windy day in 21 minutes.  # 3.85 miles",,3.85
"A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance?

Therefore, for 1 gram of the health food: - Vitamin E obtained = 0.09E - Vitamin A obtained = 0.08A  To meet at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to solve the following system of inequalities: \[ \begin{cases} 0.09E \geq E \\ 0.08A \geq A \end{cases} \]  Solving the first inequality: \[ 0.09E \geq E \\ 0.09E - E \geq 0 \\ 0.01E \geq 0 \\ E \geq 0 \]  This inequality holds true for all positive values of $E$.

So, we can set up the equation:  $\frac{2P}{1.10} = P \times (1+0.10)^2$  Solving this equation will give us the value of $P$.  $\frac{2P}{1.10} = P \times 1.21$  $2P = 1.21 \times 1.10 \times P$  $2 = 1.331 \implies P = \frac{2}{1.331}$  Now, we can calculate the percent population increase over the last year:  Percent increase $= \left(\frac{P}{1.10} - P\right) \times 100\%$  Percent increase $= \left(\frac{\frac{2}{1.331}}{1.10} - \frac{2}{1.331}\right) \times 100\%$  Percent increase $= \left(\frac{1.509}{1.10} - \frac{2}{1.331}\right) \times 100\%$  Percent increase $= \left(1.372 - 1.504\right) \times 100\%$  Percent increase $= -0.132 \times 100\%$  Percent increase $= -13.2\%$  Therefore, the closest answer choice to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year is $\boxed{D) 65\%}$.   #-13.2%",,-13.2

Train A starts at 11 am and Train B starts at 2 pm, so Train B starts 3 hours after Train A.  Let $t$ be the time it takes for Train A to meet Train B after Train B starts its journey.  Distance covered by Train A in $t$ hours = Speed of Train A $\times$ time = $40t$ km  Distance covered by Train B in $t$ hours = Speed of Train B $\times$ time = $72t$ km  Since the total distance covered by both trains is the same when they meet, we have:  $40t + 72t = 112t$ km  Now, we know that Train B starts 3 hours after Train A. So, when Train B starts, Train A has already covered a distance of $40 \times 3 = 120$ km.  Therefore, the total distance between the two trains when Train B starts is $112t - 120$ km.  The relative speed of Train B with respect to Train A is $72 - 40 = 32$ kmph.  Now, we can find the time it takes for Train B to catch up to Train A after Train B starts its journey:  $t = \frac{112t - 120}{32}$  $32t = 112t - 120$  $80t = 120$  $t = \frac{120}{80} = 1.5$ hours  Since Train B starts at 2 pm and it takes 1.5 hours to catch up to Train A, the two trains will meet at 3:30 pm.  Therefore, the correct answer is:  # 5 pm on the next day",,5.0

According to the second statement, if Mark gives John one third of his money, John will have $x + \frac{x}{3} = \frac{4x}{3} = 75$. Substituting $x = 50$, we get $\frac{4 \times 50}{3} = 66.\overline{6}$.  Therefore, John had Rs. 66.\overline{6}, which is closest to Rs. 66. Hence, the answer is $\boxed{B) 60}$.  #B) 60",,60.0

If there is exactly one water lily on the lake initially, and it takes $60$ days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies, we can set up the following equation:  $2^{30} = 2^{(D/2)}$  Solving for $D$:  $2^{30} = 2^{(D/2)}$  $30 = D/2$  $D = 60$  Therefore, if initially there were $64$ water lilies on the lake, we can set up the following equation:  $64 \cdot 2^{x/2} = 2^{30}$  Solving for $x$:  $64 \cdot 2^{x/2} = 2^{30}$  $2^{6} \cdot 2^{x/2} = 2^{30}$  $2^{6 + x/2} = 2^{30}$  $6 + x/2 = 30$  $x/2 = 24$  $x = 48$  Therefore, the lake will be fully covered with lilies after $48$ days.  # 48",,48.0

If all 4 points are vertices of the pentagon (A, B, C, D, or E), there are 5 ways to choose them. 2. If 3 points are vertices of the pentagon and 1 point is the center F, there are 5 ways to choose the 3 vertices. 3.

Similarly, since B bisects minor arc AC, the measure of minor arc BC is also 80°.  Now, we know that the sum of the measures of minor arcs AB, BC, and CD must add up to the total circumference of the circle, which is 360°.

From the information given, we know that the space shuttle takes 5 seconds to pass a point. During this time, the front of the shuttle travels a distance of $L$ meters. Therefore, we have:  $5v = L$  We are also told that at its maximum speed, the space shuttle can travel 700 meters high in 40 seconds. This means that the total distance traveled by the shuttle in 40 seconds is 700 meters. Since the shuttle has a length of $L$ meters, the distance traveled by the back of the shuttle in 40 seconds is $L$ meters less than the total distance. Therefore, we have:  $40v = 700 - L$  Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the length of the space shuttle.  Substitute $5v$ for $L$ in the second equation:  $40v = 700 - 5v$  $40v + 5v = 700$  $45v = 700$  $v = \frac{700}{45}$  $v = 15.56$ meters per second  Now, substitute $v$ back into the first equation to find $L$:  $5(15.56) = L$  $L = 77.78$ meters  Therefore, the length of the space shuttle is approximately 77.78 meters.  # $L \approx 77.78$ meters",,77.78

The area of the square is given by the formula: \( \text{Area of square} = (\text{side length})^2 \).  Given that the side length of the square is 20 cm, the area of the square is \( 20^2 = 400 \, \text{cm}^2 \).  The diameter of the semicircle is equal to the side length of the square, which is 20 cm. The radius of the semicircle is half of the diameter, so the radius \( r = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) cm.  The area of a semicircle is half the area of a full circle, so the area of one semicircle is \( \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 \).  The combined area of the two semicircles is \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 = \pi r^2 \).  Substitute the radius \( r = 10 \) cm into the formula to find the combined area of the two semicircles: \( \pi \times 10^2 = 100\pi \, \text{cm}^2 \).  Now, we can find the area of the remaining paper by subtracting the combined area of the two semicircles from the area of the square: \( 400 - 100\pi \).  Calculating this gives: \( 400 - 100\pi \approx 400 - 314.16 \approx 85.84 \, \text{cm}^2 \).

Since 75% of the men preferred red cars over green cars, the number of men who preferred red cars is $0.75 \times 0.4T = 0.3T$.   Given that 10 men liked green cars more than red, we can set up the equation:   Number of men who liked green cars more than red = Number of men who preferred green cars - Number of men who preferred red cars = 10  Let's denote the number of men who preferred green cars as $x$.   So, $x - 0.3T = 10$  We also know that the total number of people who took the survey is the sum of women and men:   $0.6T + 0.4T = T$  Solving these two equations simultaneously will give us the value of $T$, the total number of people who took the survey.

Therefore, the recursive formula is: \[ f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) \]  We can start by calculating the number of ways to reach the first few steps: - \( f(1) = 1 \) (only one way to reach the first step) - \( f(2) = 2 \) (two ways to reach the second step: 1+1 or 2)  Then, we can use the recursive formula to find the number of ways to reach the top of the 10 steps: \[ f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 2 + 1 = 3 \] \[ f(4) = f(3) + f(2) = 3 + 2 = 5 \] \[ f(5) = f(4) + f(3) = 5 + 3 = 8 \] \[ f(6) = f(5) + f(4) = 8 + 5 = 13 \] \[ f(7) = f(6) + f(5) = 13 + 8 = 21 \] \[ f(8) = f(7) + f(6) = 21 + 13 = 34 \] \[ f(9) = f(8) + f(7) = 34 + 21 = 55 \] \[ f(10) = f(9) + f(8) = 55 + 34 = 89 \]  Therefore, the boy can reach the top of the 10 steps in 89 ways.  # Answer  89",,89.0
"IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink?

So, in one gallon of soft drink, there are 0.4 gallons of orange juice and 0.6 gallons of water.  Therefore, in $x$ gallons of soft drink, there are $0.4x$ gallons of orange juice and $0.6x$ gallons of water.  We want to add additional gallons of orange juice to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink. Let's say we need to add $y$ gallons of orange juice.  After adding $y$ gallons of orange juice, the total amount of orange juice in the mixture will be $0.4x + y$, and the total amount of soft drink will be $x + y$.  According to the question, the orange juice should be 60% of the soft drink, so we can write the equation:  $\frac{0.4x + y}{x + y} = 0.6$  Solving this equation will give us the value of $y$, which is the additional gallons of orange juice needed.  $0.4x + y = 0.6(x + y)$  $0.4x + y = 0.6x + 0.6y$  $0.4y = 0.2x$  $y = 0.5x$  Therefore, we need to add 0.5 gallons of orange juice to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink.  # 0.5",,0.5

Therefore, we have: \[875 = N \cdot q_2 + r_2\]  Given that the remainders are the same, we have $r_1 = r_2$.  Now, let's express 2272 and 875 in terms of $N$: \[2272 = N \cdot q_1 + r_1 = N \cdot q_1 + r_2\] \[875 = N \cdot q_2 + r_2\]  Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get: \[2272 - 875 = N \cdot q_1 - N \cdot q_2\] \[1397 = N \cdot (q_1 - q_2)\]  Since $N$ is a 3-digit number, the possible values for $N$ are between 100 and 999.  To find the sum of the digits of $N$, we need to find a value of $N$ such that $N$ divides 1397 and is a 3-digit number.  Checking the factors of 1397, we find that 1397 is divisible by 11.

There are 500 numbers in the set S that are multiples of 2 (from 2 to 1000) and 200 numbers that are multiples of 5 (from 5 to 1000).
