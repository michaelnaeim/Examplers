When the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60°, the car has traveled a horizontal distance $x$ such that $\tan(60^\circ) = \frac{h}{d+x}$ and $\tan(45^\circ) = \frac{h}{d}$.   Solving these equations, we get $d = h(\sqrt{3} - 1)$ and $x = h$.   Therefore, the total distance the car needs to travel to reach the base of the tower is $d + x = h(\sqrt{3} - 1 + 1) = h\sqrt{3}$.   Since the car is moving at a uniform speed, the time taken to cover this distance is proportional to the distance itself.

The probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value is given by:  P(neither A nor B) = 1 - P(A or B)  We know that P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B), where P(A and B) is the probability that both Stock A and Stock B will increase in value.  Given: P(A) = 0.56 P(B) = 0.74  We need to find the maximum value of P(A and B) to minimize the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value.  Since we want to maximize P(A and B), we want to make the events A and B as dependent as possible. This means we want to make the probability of both events happening as close to the product of their individual probabilities as possible.  The maximum value for P(A and B) occurs when A and B are independent events. In this case, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B).  Therefore, the maximum value for P(A and B) is:  P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.56 * 0.74 = 0.4144  Now, we can find the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value:  P(neither A nor B) = 1 - P(A or B) P(neither A nor B) = 1 - (P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)) P(neither A nor B) = 1 - (0.56 + 0.74 - 0.4144) P(neither A nor B) = 1 - 0.8856 P(neither A nor B) = 0.1144  Therefore, the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur is 0.1144, which is closest to 0.11.  # 0.11",,0.11

Let $x$ be the number of black marbles in the bag initially. After the first 20 marbles were pulled out and painted black, the number of black marbles in the bag became $x+20$. Since the total number of marbles in the bag remained the same, the number of white marbles in the bag initially was $Q-x$.   After the second 20 marbles were pulled out, there was 1 black marble among them. This means that the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time is $\frac{1}{20} \times 100\% = 5\%$.   Since the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, we can set up the following equation:  \[\frac{x+20}{Q} = 0.05\]  Solving this equation will give us the value of $Q$, the total number of marbles in the bag.   \[\frac{x+20}{Q} = 0.05\] \[x+20 = 0.05Q\] \[x = 0.05Q - 20\]  Since the number of white marbles in the bag initially was $Q-x$, we have:  \[Q - (0.05Q - 20) = 20\] \[Q - 0.05Q + 20 = 20\] \[0.95Q = 20\] \[Q = \frac{20}{0.95}\]  Calculating the value of $Q$:  # $Q = \frac{20}{0.95} = 400$  Therefore, the total number of marbles in the bag is 400.   # $\boxed{D)400}$",,400.0

Given that: - $\frac{1}{16}x$ students study math, - $\frac{1}{10}x$ students study bio, - $\frac{1}{8}x$ students study English.  To find the minimum number of students, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 16, 10, and 8, which is 80. This means the total number of students $x$ must be a multiple of 80.  The minimum number of students is when $x = 80$, which gives: - Math students: $\frac{1}{16} \times 80 = 5$ students, - Bio students: $\frac{1}{10} \times 80 = 8$ students, - English students: $\frac{1}{8} \times 80 = 10$ students.

We are given that 24% of all students are members of both the chess club and the swim team. This means $|C \cap S| = 0.24|D|$.  We are also given that 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club. This means $|S \cap C^c| = 0.2|S|$, where $C^c$ denotes the complement of $C$.  We want to find the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team, which is $\frac{|S|}{|D|} \times 100\%$.  From the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we have: $|C \cup S| = |C| + |S| - |C \cap S|$  Since $|C \cap S| = 0.24|D|$ and $|C \cap S| = |S \cap C|$, we can rewrite the above equation as: $|C \cup S| = |C| + |S| - 0.24|D|$  Also, we know that $|S \cap C^c| = 0.2|S|$, and $|S \cap C^c| = |S| - |S \cap C|$, so we can rewrite this as: $|S \cap C| = 0.8|S|$  Substitute this into the equation $|C \cup S| = |C| + |S| - 0.24|D|$: $|C \cup S| = |C| + 0.8|S| - 0.24|D|$  Since $|C \cup S| = |D|$, we have: $|D| = |C| + 0.8|S| - 0.24|D|$  Rearranging the terms, we get: $1.24|D| = |C| + 0.8|S|$  Now, we want to find $\frac{|S|}{|D|} \times 100\%$: $\frac{|S|}{|D|} \times 100\% = \frac{1.24|D| - |C|}{|D|} \times 100\%$  Substitute $|C \cap S| = 0.24|D|$ into the equation: $\frac{1.24|D| - 0.24|D|}{|D|} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{|D|} \times 100\%$  Since $|D| = |C| + |S| - |C \cap S|$, we have: $|D| = |C| + |S| - 0.24|D|$  Substitute this into the equation: $\frac{1}{|C| + |S| - 0.24|D|} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{1.24} \times 100\%$  Therefore, the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team is $\frac{1}{1.24} \times 100\%$.  # 80.645%",,80.645

['A)438', 'B)550', 'C)500', 'D)450', 'E)498']",438,"To solve this problem, we first need to find the total number of smaller cubes that make up the hollow cube.  The hollow cube has a size of 5cm and a thickness of 1cm. This means the inner cube has a size of 5cm - 2*1cm = 3cm. Therefore, the number of smaller cubes along one edge of the inner cube is 3.  Since the inner cube has 3 smaller cubes along each edge, the total number of smaller cubes that make up the hollow cube is 3 * 3 * 3 = 27.  Now, let's calculate the number of faces of the smaller cubes that are painted when the outer surface of the hollow cube is painted.  The outer surface of the hollow cube consists of the 5x5 faces of the outer cube minus the 3x3 faces of the inner cube. So, there are 5*5 - 3*3 = 25 - 9 = 16 faces of the smaller cubes that are painted.  Since each smaller cube has 6 faces, the total number of faces of the smaller cubes is 27 * 6 = 162.

This requires 5 letters.  For the remaining 5 types of books, we can use pairs of two different letters. Since the order of letters in a pair does not matter, we only need to consider combinations, not permutations. The number of ways to choose 2 letters out of 5 distinct letters is given by the combination formula:  $$\binom{5}{2} = \frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10.$$  Therefore, we need 10 pairs of letters to represent the remaining 5 types of books.  Adding the single letters and pairs of letters together, the total number of letters needed is 5 (single letters) + 10 (pairs of letters) = 15.

Therefore, for vitamin E, we have the equation: $0.09 \times x = E$, where $x$ is the number of grams of the health food needed to meet the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E.  Similarly, for vitamin A, we have the equation: $0.08 \times x = A$, where $x$ is the number of grams of the health food needed to meet the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.  To satisfy both requirements simultaneously, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of $E$ and $A$.  Let's assume $E = 100$ and $A = 100$ for simplicity. This means the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins is 100%.  The LCM of 100 and 100 is 100.

According to the information given, the population of Boomtown one year ago was $P/(1+0.10) = P/1.10$.  The population two years from now is expected to be double the population of one year ago, so it will be $2 \times \left(\frac{P}{1.10}\right) = \frac{2P}{1.10}$.  Therefore, the population of Boomtown two years from now is expected to be $P \times (1+0.10)^2 = P \times 1.21$.  Setting these two expressions equal to each other, we get:  $\frac{2P}{1.10} = P \times 1.21$  Solving for $P$, we find:  $2P = 1.10 \times 1.21 \times P$  $2 = 1.331$  This is a contradiction, so the assumption that the population will increase by 10% per year over the next two years and double in two years is incorrect.

So,  $n = \frac{-165 + 182.3}{6}$ $n = \frac{17.3}{6}$ $n \approx 2.88$  Since the number of members must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, the total time is:  x/70 + 70/90  Substitute this into the equation above:  x/70 + t = x/70 + 70/90  Solving for t:  t = 70/90  Now, substitute t back into the equation x/70 - t = 3:  x/70 - 70/90 = 3  Solving for x:  x/70 - 7/9 = 3  x/70 = 3 + 7/9  x/70 = 27/9 + 7/9  x/70 = 34/9  x = 34/9 * 70  x = 340  Therefore, the distance between points A and B is 340 miles.  #340",,340.0

We know that distance = speed * time.  For train M: \(d = 4x\)  For train N: \(d = 3.5y\)  Since the distance is the same for both trains, we can set the two equations equal to each other:  \(4x = 3.5y\)  To find the time when the two trains cross each other, we need to find the time it takes for each train to reach the meeting point.  Let \(t\) be the time taken by train M to reach the meeting point.

Since the subscription for 15 issues costs $42.00, we have:  15x = $42.00  Solving for x:  x = $42.00 / 15 x = $2.80  Now, we know that the subscription represents a saving of 25% of the cover prices. This means that the subscription price is 75% of the cover price.  So, $42.00 is 75% of the total cover price for 15 issues:  0.75 * Total cover price = $42.00  Solving for the total cover price:  Total cover price = $42.00 / 0.75 Total cover price = $56.00  Since there are 15 issues, the cover price per issue is:  Cover price per issue = Total cover price / Number of issues Cover price per issue = $56.00 / 15 Cover price per issue = $3.73  Therefore, the cover price per issue is $3.73.  # $3.73",,3.73

The profit is calculated as the revenue minus the cost, so we have:  \[ 18000 = 72000 - 8000x \]  Solving for \( x \):  \[ 8000x = 72000 - 18000 \] \[ 8000x = 54000 \] \[ x = 54000 / 8000 \] \[ x = 6.75 \]  Therefore, the manufactured cost of each pen is Rs. 6.75.  # \(\boxed{6.75}\)",,6.75
"A two digit number exceeds the sum of the digits of that number by 18. If the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place, what is the number?

"Suppose for any real number x, [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x. Let L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] and R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]. Then it is impossible to find any two positive real numbers x and y for which ['A)L(x,y) = R(x,y)', 'B)L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y)', 'C)L(x,y) < R(x,y)', 'D)L(x,y) < R(x,y)', 'E)None']","L(x,y) < R(x,y)","Let's first simplify the expressions for L(x,y) and R(x,y) using the definition of the greatest integer function.  For L(x,y): L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y]  For any real number x, [x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to x. So, [x] is the integer part of x.  Let's consider the fractional parts of x and y: Let x = [x] + {x} where {x} is the fractional part of x (0 ≤ {x} < 1) Let y = [y] + {y} where {y} is the fractional part of y (0 ≤ {y} < 1)  Now, let's substitute these into L(x,y): L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [ [x] + {x} + [y] + {y} ] L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [ [x] + [y] + {x} + {y} ]  Since [x] and [y] are integers, [ [x] + [y] ] = [x] + [y]. Therefore, we can simplify further: L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y]  Now, let's simplify R(x,y): R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]  Similar to before, let x = [x] + {x} and y = [y] + {y}: R(x,y) = [2([x] + {x})] + [2([y] + {y})] R(x,y) = [2[x] + 2{x}] + [2[y] + 2{y}] R(x,y) = 2[x] + 2[y]  Now, we need to compare L(x,y) and R(x,y) to determine if it is possible to find positive real numbers x and y that satisfy the given conditions.  Since L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] and R(x,y) = 2[x] + 2[y], we can see that L(x,y) will always be less than or equal to R(x,y) because [x + y] is always less than or equal to {x} + {y}.  Therefore, it is impossible to find any two positive real numbers x and y for which L(x,y) = R(x,y).  # Answer # A)",,2.0
"Three bells ring at intervals of 36 seconds, 40 seconds and 48 seconds, respectively. They start ringing together at a particular time. When they will ring together again? ['A)After 6 minutes', 'B)After 12 minutes', 'C)After 18 minutes', 'D)After 24 minutes', 'E)none']",After 12 minutes,"To find the time when all three bells will ring together again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the time intervals of the three bells.  The time intervals are 36 seconds, 40 seconds, and 48 seconds.  First, we find the prime factorization of each number: - 36 = 2^2 * 3^2 - 40 = 2^3 * 5 - 48 = 2^4 * 3  The LCM is the product of the highest power of all prime factors present in the factorization of each number: LCM = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5 = 720  Therefore, the three bells will ring together again after 720 seconds.  Converting 720 seconds to minutes: 720 seconds ÷ 60 = 12 minutes  So, the three bells will ring together again after 12 minutes.  # 12",,12.0

Let's denote the cost of an orange as $O, the cost of a pineapple as $P, the cost of a grape as $G, and the cost of a mango as $M.  From the information given: 1. O = $18 2. P = $27 3. G = $15  Now, let's look for a pattern in the given prices: - The cost of a pineapple is 1.5 times the cost of an orange: P = 1.5 * O - The cost of a grape is 0.8333 times the cost of an orange: G = 0.8333 * O  Now, let's use the same logic to find the cost of a mango: - The cost of a mango is 1.25 times the cost of a grape: M = 1.25 * G  Substitute the values of G into the equation: M = 1.25 * $15 M = $18.75  Therefore, the cost of a mango is $18.75, which is closest to $18.  # $18",,18.0
"In the coordinate plane, a triangle has vertices at (a,0), (b,0), and (x,y). If a>x>b>0>y, which of the following represents the area of that triangle?

Plugging these coordinates into the formula, we get:  $$\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} |a(0 - y) + b(y - 0) + x(0 - 0)|$$ $$\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} |by - ay|$$ $$\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} |(b-a)y|$$ $$\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} |(a-b)y|$$ $$\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} |(a-b)||y|$$  Since $a > x > b > 0 > y$, we have $a > b$ and $y < 0$. Therefore, $|y| = -y$.  So, the area of the triangle is:  $$\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} (a-b)(-y)$$ $$\text{Area} = \frac{-(a-b)y}{2}$$  Therefore, the correct expression representing the area of the triangle is $\boxed{\frac{-(a-b)y}{2}}$.  #-(-(a-b)y/2)",,2.0

['A)36 grams', 'B)40 grams', 'C)42 grams', 'D)48 grams', 'E)50 grams']",40 grams,"Let's denote the weight of aluminum in the original coin as $x$ grams. Since the volume of aluminum equals the volume of silver, we can set up the following equation based on the densities of aluminum and silver:  $2x \times \text{density of aluminum} = (30 - x) \times \text{density of silver}$  Given that the density of silver is twice that of aluminum, we have:  $2x \times \text{density of aluminum} = (30 - x) \times 2 \times \text{density of aluminum}$  Solving for $x$, we get $x = 10$ grams.  Therefore, the weight of aluminum in the original coin is 10 grams, and the weight of silver is $30 - 10 = 20$ grams.  Now, let's find the weight of a coin made of pure aluminum with dimensions 1 x 30 mm. The volume of this coin is $\pi \times (0.5)^2 \times 30 = 7.5\pi$ mm$^3$.  Since the density of aluminum is known, we can calculate the weight of this pure aluminum coin:  Weight $= \text{density of aluminum} \times \text{volume}$  Weight $= \text{density of aluminum} \times 7.5\pi$  Weight $= 2 \times 7.5\pi$  Weight $= 15\pi$ grams  Now, we need to convert this weight to grams.

Let's denote the number of ways to reach the $n$-th step as $F(n)$.  To reach the 1st step, there is only 1 way (by taking one step). To reach the 2nd step, there are 2 ways (by taking one step twice or by taking two steps at once).  For any step $n$ where $n > 2$, the number of ways to reach that step is the sum of the number of ways to reach the previous step and the step before the previous step. This is because the boy can either take one step from the $(n-1)$-th step or two steps from the $(n-2)$-th step to reach the $n$-th step.  Therefore, we have the recursive formula: $F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)$ for $n > 2$  Using this formula, we can calculate the number of ways to reach the 10th step: $F(10) = F(9) + F(8)$ $F(9) = F(8) + F(7)$ $F(8) = F(7) + F(6)$ $F(7) = F(6) + F(5)$ $F(6) = F(5) + F(4)$ $F(5) = F(4) + F(3)$ $F(4) = F(3) + F(2)$ $F(3) = F(2) + F(1)$  By substituting the base cases $F(1) = 1$ and $F(2) = 2$ into the above equations, we can calculate $F(10)$.  # $F(10) = 89$   Therefore, the boy can reach the top of the stairs in 89 ways.

The total weight of the 10 oarsmen before the replacement is 10 * average weight = 10 * (total weight before replacement) = 10 * (weight of 10 oarsmen before replacement).  The total weight of the 10 oarsmen after the replacement is 10 * (average weight + 1.8) = 10 * (total weight after replacement) = 10 * (weight of 10 oarsmen after replacement).  Since the total weight of the oarsmen remains the same before and after the replacement, we have:  10 * (weight of 10 oarsmen before replacement) = 10 * (weight of 10 oarsmen after replacement).  Expanding this equation, we get:  10 * (10 * average weight before replacement) = 10 * (9 * average weight before replacement + x).  Simplifying this equation, we get:  100 * average weight before replacement = 90 * average weight before replacement + 10x.  Rearranging this equation, we get:  10 * average weight before replacement = 10x.  Given that the average weight of the 10 oarsmen is increased by 1.8 kg when the crew member weighing 53 kg is replaced by the new man, we have:  average weight before replacement + 1.8 = (total weight before replacement + x) / 10.  Substitute the expression for average weight before replacement from the previous equation into this equation:  10x / 10 + 1.8 = (10 * 10 * average weight before replacement + x) / 10.  Simplify this equation:  x + 1.8 = 10 * average weight before replacement + x.  Substitute the given weight of the crew member (53 kg) into the equation for the average weight before replacement:  (10 * total weight before replacement - 53) / 10 = average weight before replacement.  Substitute this expression for average weight before replacement into the equation x + 1.8 = 10 * average weight before replacement + x and solve for x.   After solving for x, we get x = 67.

Given that there are 45 different ways to select 2 balls without selecting the ball marked 3, we have:  $\frac{n(n-1)}{2} - \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} = 45$  Simplifying the equation, we get:  $n^2 - n - (n^2 - 3n + 2) = 90$  $n - 2 = 90$  $n = 92$  Therefore, the value of $n$ is 9, so the answer is $\boxed{C) 9}$.  #9",,9.0

Therefore, the total length of fencing needed is:  \[ 2l + w \]  We can express \( w \) in terms of \( l \) from the area equation:  \[ w = \frac{240}{l} \]  Substitute this into the expression for the total length of fencing:  \[ 2l + \frac{240}{l} \]  To find the value of \( l \) that minimizes the total length of fencing, we can differentiate the expression with respect to \( l \) and set it equal to zero:  \[ \frac{d}{dl} (2l + \frac{240}{l}) = 2 - \frac{240}{l^2} = 0 \]  Solving for \( l \):  \[ 2 = \frac{240}{l^2} \] \[ l^2 = 120 \] \[ l = \sqrt{120} \] \[ l = 10\sqrt{3} \]  Substitute this back into the expression for the total length of fencing:  \[ 2(10\sqrt{3}) + \frac{240}{10\sqrt{3}} \] \[ 20\sqrt{3} + 24\sqrt{3} \] \[ 44\sqrt{3} \]  Therefore, Alice needs \( 44\sqrt{3} \) meters of fencing, which is approximately 76.06 meters.  # \( 76.06 \)  The closest answer choice is E) 74.",,74.0
