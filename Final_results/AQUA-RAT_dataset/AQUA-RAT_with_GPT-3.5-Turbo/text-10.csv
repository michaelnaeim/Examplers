"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower.

After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? ['A)5(√3 + 1)', 'B)6(√3 + √2)', 'C)7(√3 – 1)', 'D)8(√3 – 2)', 'E)None of these']",5(√3 + 1),"Let the distance between the car and the base of the tower be $d$ and let the height of the tower be $h$.   When the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60°, the car has traveled a horizontal distance $x$ such that $\tan(60^\circ) = \frac{h}{d+x}$ and $\tan(45^\circ) = \frac{h}{d}$.   Solving these equations, we get $d = h(\sqrt{3} - 1)$ and $x = h(\sqrt{3} + 1)$.   Since the car is moving at a uniform speed, the ratio of the horizontal speed to the vertical speed is constant.   Let the speed of the car be $v$. The vertical speed is $v\sin(60^\circ)$ and the horizontal speed is $v\cos(60^\circ)$.   The time taken to cover the distance $x$ is $\frac{x}{v\cos(60^\circ)} = \frac{h(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{v\cos(60^\circ)}$.   To find the total time taken to reach the base of the tower, we need to add the time taken to cover the distance $d$.   The time taken to cover the distance $d$ is $\frac{d}{v\cos(45^\circ)} = \frac{h(\sqrt{3} - 1)}{v\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}$.   Adding these two times together gives the total time taken.   # $T = \frac{h(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{v\cos(60^\circ)} + \frac{h(\sqrt{3} - 1)}{v\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}$.   To find the value of $T$, we need to know the value of $v$ in terms of $h$.   Since the car is moving at a uniform speed, the total distance traveled is $d + x = 2h\sqrt{3}$.   The total time taken to cover this distance is $\frac{2h\sqrt{3}}{v}$.   Setting this equal to the time calculated above, we can solve for $v$.   # $T = \frac{h(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{v\cos(60^\circ)} + \frac{h(\sqrt{3} - 1)}{v\frac{1}{\sqrt{2)}}} = \frac{2h\sqrt{3}}{v}$.   Solving for $v$, we get $v = \frac{h\sqrt{6}}{2}$.   Substitute this back into the expression for $T$ and simplify to find the final answer.   # $T = \frac{h(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{\frac{h\sqrt{6}}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{2}} + \frac{h(\sqrt{3} - 1)}{\frac{h\sqrt{6}}{2}\cdot\sqrt{2}} = \frac{4(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{\sqrt{6}} + \frac{2(\sqrt{3} - 1)}{\sqrt{6}} = 6(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2})$.   Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\text{B) }6(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2})}$.",,2.0

Therefore, the number of toys made by Jacob is $\frac{245}{16} \approx 15.31$.  So, the answer is approximately 15 toys.  # Answer  A)15",,15.0

Given that: - $\frac{1}{16}x$ students study math, - $\frac{1}{10}x$ students study bio, - $\frac{1}{8}x$ students study English.  To find the minimum number of students, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 16, 10, and 8, which is 80. This means the total number of students $x$ must be a multiple of 80.  The minimum number of students is when $x = 80$, and the number of students studying each subject is: - Math: $\frac{1}{16} \times 80 = 5$ students, - Bio: $\frac{1}{10} \times 80 = 8$ students, - English: $\frac{1}{8} \times 80 = 10$ students.  So, the minimum number of students is $80 + 5 + 8 + 10 = 103$.  To find the maximum number of students, we need to find the highest common factor (HCF) of 16, 10, and 8, which is 2. This means the total number of students $x$ must be a multiple of 2.  The maximum number of students is when $x = 9998$ (the largest 4-digit number divisible by 2), and the number of students studying each subject is: - Math: $\frac{1}{16} \times 9998 = 624.875$ students (round up to 625), - Bio: $\frac{1}{10} \times 9998 = 999.8$ students (round up to 1000), - English: $\frac{1}{8} \times 9998 = 1249.75$ students (round up to 1250).  So, the maximum number of students is $9998 + 625 + 1000 + 1250 = 12873$.  The difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is $12873 - 103 = 12770$.  # Answer  12770",,12770.0

We are given that 24% of all students are members of both the chess club and the swim team. This means $|C \cap S| = 0.24|D|$.  We are also given that 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club. This means $|S \setminus C| = 0.2|S|$.  We want to find the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team, which is $\frac{|S|}{|D|} \times 100\%$.  From the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we have: $|C \cup S| = |C| + |S| - |C \cap S|$  Since $|C \cap S| = 0.24|D|$ and $|C \cup S| = |C| + |S| - |C \cap S| = |C| + |S| - 0.24|D| = |D|$, we can write: $|C| + |S| - 0.24|D| = |D|$  Rearranging the terms, we get: $|S| = 0.24|D| - |C| + |D|$  Since $|S \setminus C| = 0.2|S|$, we have $|S \setminus C| = 0.2(0.24|D| - |C| + |D|)$.  Substitute $|C \cap S| = 0.24|D|$ into the equation above, we get: $|S \setminus C| = 0.2(0.24|D| - |C| + |D|)$ $0.2|S| = 0.048|D| - 0.2|C| + 0.2|D|$  Substitute $|S| = 0.24|D| - |C| + |D|$ into the equation above, we get: $0.2(0.24|D| - |C| + |D|) = 0.048|D| - 0.2|C| + 0.2|D|$ $0.048|D| - 0.2|C| + 0.2|D| = 0.048|D| - 0.2|C| + 0.2|D|$  This equation holds true, which means our calculations are consistent.  Now, we want to find $\frac{|S|}{|D|} \times 100\%$: $\frac{|S|}{|D|} \times 100\% = \frac{0.24|D| - |C| + |D|}{|D|} \times 100\%$ $= 0.24 - \frac{|C|}{|D|} + 1 \times 100\%$  Since $\frac{|C|}{|D|}$ represents the percentage of students who are members of the chess club, and we know that $|C \cap S| = 0.24|D|$, we have $\frac{|C|}{|D|} = 0.24$.  Therefore, the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team is: $0.24 - 0.24 + 1 \times 100\% = 1 \times 100\% = 100\%$  # Answer  100%",,100.0

['A)438', 'B)550', 'C)500', 'D)450', 'E)498']",438,"To solve this problem, we first need to find the total number of smaller cubes that make up the hollow cube.  The hollow cube has a size of 5cm and a thickness of 1cm. This means the inner cube has a size of 5cm - 2*1cm = 3cm. Therefore, the number of smaller cubes along one edge of the inner cube is 3.  Since the inner cube has 3 smaller cubes along each edge, the total number of smaller cubes that make up the inner cube is 3 * 3 * 3 = 27.  Now, let's find the total number of smaller cubes that make up the hollow cube. Since the hollow cube has a size of 5cm along each edge, the number of smaller cubes along one edge of the hollow cube is 5. Therefore, the total number of smaller cubes that make up the hollow cube is 5 * 5 * 5 = 125.  Now, let's find the number of faces of the smaller cubes that are painted. Since the outer surface of the hollow cube is painted, the number of faces painted is equal to the number of faces of the hollow cube. The hollow cube has 6 faces, and each face is made up of 5 * 5 = 25 smaller cubes. Therefore, the total number of faces painted is 6 * 25 = 150.  Finally, the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is the total number of faces of the smaller cubes minus the number of faces painted. Since each smaller cube has 6 faces, the total number of faces of the smaller cubes is 125 * 6 = 750.

"One gram of a certain health food contains 9 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins?

From the information given, we know that 1 gram of the health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.  Therefore, for vitamin E, we have the equation: $0.09 \times x = E$, where $x$ is the number of grams of the health food needed to meet the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E.  Similarly, for vitamin A, we have the equation: $0.08 \times x = A$, where $x$ is the number of grams of the health food needed to meet the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.  To satisfy both requirements simultaneously, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of $E$ and $A$.  Let's assume $E = 100$ and $A = 125$ (these values are arbitrary and chosen for simplicity).  The LCM of 100 and 125 is 500.  Therefore, we need to find the number of grams of the health food needed to provide at least 500 units of both vitamins.  For vitamin E: $0.09 \times x = 100$ $x = \frac{100}{0.09} \approx 1111.11$ grams  For vitamin A: $0.08 \times x = 125$ $x = \frac{125}{0.08} = 1562.5$ grams  To satisfy both requirements, we need to take the maximum of these two values, which is 1562.5 grams.  Therefore, the number of grams of the health food that must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins is 1562.5 grams.  # 1562.5",,1562.5

The radius of the circle traced out by the point is 10 centimeters. Therefore, the circumference of this circle is given by:  Circumference = 2 * π * radius Circumference = 2 * π * 10 Circumference = 20π centimeters  Now, we need to find the total number of revolutions the fan blade makes in 30 seconds. The fan runs at a rate of 300 revolutions per minute, so in 30 seconds, it will make:  Revolutions = (300 revolutions/minute) * (30 minutes/60 seconds) Revolutions = 150 revolutions  Finally, the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade is equal to the circumference of the circle times the total number of revolutions:  Distance = Circumference * Revolutions Distance = 20π * 150 Distance = 3000π  Therefore, the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade after 30 seconds is 3000π centimeters.  # 3000π",,3000.0

Area of two semicircles: Each semicircle has a diameter equal to the side of the square, which is 20 cm. The radius of each semicircle is half of the diameter, so the radius is 10 cm.  The area of a semicircle is half the area of a full circle: Area of one semicircle = 1/2 * π * radius² = 1/2 * π * 10 cm * 10 cm = 50π cm²  Since there are two semicircles, the total area of the two semicircles is: Total area of two semicircles = 2 * 50π cm² = 100π cm²  3.

"For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought? ['A)4', 'B)3', 'C)2', 'D)1', 'E)0']",2,"Let's denote the number of copper coins as $x$ and the number of brass coins as $y$.   Given that the diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin, the total amount earned from the copper coins is $20x$ cents and the total amount earned from the brass coins is $25y$ cents.  We are also given that after one dive, the diver got $3.40, which is equivalent to 340 cents.  Therefore, we have the equation $20x + 25y = 340$.  Since we are looking for the minimum number of copper coins brought, we want to minimize $x$.  To minimize $x$, we need to maximize $y$. Since the diver gets more money for brass coins, it is beneficial to have more brass coins.  Let's start by trying to maximize $y$:  If we assume that all the coins are brass coins ($x=0$), then $25y = 340$, which gives $y = 13.6$. Since the number of coins must be a whole number, this assumption is not valid.  Let's try with one copper coin ($x=1$):  $20(1) + 25y = 340$  $25y = 320$  $y = 12.8$  Again, this is not a valid solution.  Let's try with two copper coins ($x=2$):  $20(2) + 25y = 340$  $40 + 25y = 340$  $25y = 300$  $y = 12$  This is a valid solution, and it minimizes the number of copper coins brought.  Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins that the diver brought is $\boxed{2}$.  # Answer  2",,2.0

The time taken by train M to travel from City A to City B is 4 hours, and the time taken by train N to travel from City B to City A is 3.5 hours.  Let \(d\) be the distance between City A and City B. We know that distance = speed * time.  For train M: \(d = 4x\)  For train N: \(d = 3.5y\)  Since the distance is the same for both trains, we can set the two expressions equal to each other:  \(4x = 3.5y\)  To find the time when the two trains cross each other, we need to find the time taken by each train to reach the meeting point.  Let \(t\) be the time taken by train M to reach the meeting point. Therefore, the time taken by train N to reach the meeting point would be \(t - 2\) (since train N started 2 hours later than train M).  Distance covered by train M in time \(t\) = \(xt\)  Distance covered by train N in time \(t-2\) = \(y(t-2)\)  Since they meet at the same point, the distances covered by both trains are equal:  \(xt = y(t-2)\)  Now, we have two equations:  1. \(4x = 3.5y\) 2. \(xt = y(t-2)\)  We can solve these two equations to find the values of \(x\) and \(y\), and then find the time \(t\) when they meet.  Let's solve these equations:  From equation 1: \(x = \frac{3.5y}{4}\)  Substitute this into equation 2:  \(\frac{3.5yt}{4} = y(t-2)\)  Solving for \(t\):  \(3.5t = 4t - 8\)  \(0.5t = 8\)  \(t = 16\) hours  Therefore, the two trains will cross each other 16 hours after train M leaves City A, which is at 5 am.

Then it is impossible to find any two positive real numbers x and y for which ['A)L(x,y) = R(x,y)', 'B)L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y)', 'C)L(x,y) < R(x,y)', 'D)L(x,y) < R(x,y)', 'E)None']","L(x,y) < R(x,y)","Let's first simplify the expressions for L(x,y) and R(x,y) using the definition of the greatest integer function.  For L(x,y): L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y]  For any real number x, [x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to x. This means that [x] = n if and only if n ≤ x < n+1 for some integer n.  Therefore, [x] + [y] + [x + y] will be the sum of three integers, which are the greatest integers less than or equal to x, y, and x + y respectively.  For R(x,y): R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]  Similarly, [2x] and [2y] are the greatest integers less than or equal to 2x and 2y respectively.  Now, let's analyze the relationship between L(x,y) and R(x,y).  If we compare the values of L(x,y) and R(x,y), we can see that L(x,y) will always be less than or equal to R(x,y) for any real numbers x and y.  This is because in L(x,y), we are taking the greatest integer of x, y, and x + y, while in R(x,y), we are taking the greatest integer of 2x and 2y. Since 2x and 2y are always greater than or equal to x, y, and x + y, it follows that R(x,y) will always be greater than or equal to L(x,y).  Therefore, it is impossible to find any two positive real numbers x and y for which L(x,y) = R(x,y). This means that the correct answer is:  # A) ['A)L(x,y) = R(x,y)']",,2.0
"Three bells ring at intervals of 36 seconds, 40 seconds and 48 seconds, respectively. They start ringing together at a particular time. When they will ring together again? ['A)After 6 minutes', 'B)After 12 minutes', 'C)After 18 minutes', 'D)After 24 minutes', 'E)none']",After 12 minutes,"To find the time when all three bells will ring together again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the time intervals of the three bells.  The time intervals are 36 seconds, 40 seconds, and 48 seconds.  First, we find the prime factorization of each interval: - 36 = 2^2 * 3^2 - 40 = 2^3 * 5 - 48 = 2^4 * 3  To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations: LCM = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5 = 720  Therefore, the three bells will ring together again after 720 seconds.  Converting 720 seconds to minutes: 720 seconds ÷ 60 = 12 minutes  So, the three bells will ring together again after 12 minutes.  # 12",,12.0

Now, substitute $W - B = 2.5B$ into the equation above to get: $125 + 2.5B = 250$.  Solving for $B$, we find: $2.5B = 125$, $B = 50$.  Now, substitute $B = 50$ into $W - B = 2.5B$ to find $W$: $W - 50 = 2.5 \times 50$, $W = 175$.  Finally, the number of files NOT infected by a worm is: $250 - W = 250 - 175 = 75$.  Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{C) 75}$.  # Answer  C) 75",,75.0

To reach the 2nd step, there are 2 ways (take one step twice or take two steps at once).  For any step $n$ where $n > 2$, the number of ways to reach that step is the sum of the number of ways to reach the previous step and the step before the previous step.

['A)37', 'B)38', 'C)36', 'D)30', 'E)39']",39,"Let the three consecutive integers be \(n-1\), \(n\), and \(n+1\). The product of these three integers is \((n-1) \cdot n \cdot (n+1)\).  Given that the product can be expressed as \(727+728+729\), we have:  \[(n-1) \cdot n \cdot (n+1) = 727+728+729\] \[n^3 - n = 2184\] \[n^3 - n - 2184 = 0\]  Now, we need to find the integer value of \(n\) that satisfies this equation. We can start by trying different values of \(n\) until we find one that satisfies the equation.  Let's try \(n = 12\): \[12^3 - 12 - 2184 = 1728 - 12 - 2184 = 1728 - 2196 = -468\]  Let's try \(n = 13\): \[13^3 - 13 - 2184 = 2197 - 13 - 2184 = 2197 - 2197 = 0\]  Therefore, \(n = 13\) is the integer value that satisfies the equation.  The sum of the three consecutive integers is \(13-1 + 13 + 13+1 = 13+13+13 = 39\).  # Answer  39",,39.0
"The capacity of a tank of dimensions (8 m × 6 m × 2.5 m) is ['A)120 litres', 'B)1200 litres', 'C)12000 litres', 'D)120000 litres', 'E)None of these']",120000 litres,"To find the capacity of the tank, we need to calculate the volume of the tank. The volume of a rectangular tank is given by the formula:  \[ \text{Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} \]  Given that the dimensions of the tank are 8 m × 6 m × 2.5 m, we can substitute these values into the formula:  \[ \text{Volume} = 8 \, \text{m} \times 6 \, \text{m} \times 2.5 \, \text{m} \]  \[ \text{Volume} = 120 \, \text{m}^3 \]  Now, we need to convert this volume from cubic meters to liters. Since 1 cubic meter is equal to 1000 liters, we can multiply the volume in cubic meters by 1000 to get the volume in liters:  \[ \text{Volume in liters} = 120 \, \text{m}^3 \times 1000 \, \text{liters/m}^3 \]  \[ \text{Volume in liters} = 120,000 \, \text{liters} \]  Therefore, the capacity of the tank is 120,000 liters.  # \[ \text{120000 litres} \]",,120000.0

"It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour. How many minutes will it take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour? ['A)30', 'B)32', 'C)35', 'D)36', 'E)40']",30,"To find the time it takes for the worker to cycle from home to work at 6 kilometers per hour, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed.  Let the distance between home and work be D kilometers.  Given that the worker drives from home to work at 20 kilometers per hour in 9 minutes, we can find the distance D: D = speed * time D = 20 km/hr * 9/60 hr D = 3 km  Now, we can find the time it takes for the worker to cycle from home to work at 6 kilometers per hour: time = distance / speed time = 3 km / 6 km/hr time = 0.5 hr  Converting 0.5 hours to minutes: 0.5 hr * 60 min/hr = 30 min  Therefore, it will take the worker 30 minutes to cycle from home to work at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour.  # 30",,30.0
"Two friends are eating a jar full of candies. Had P eaten alone, it would have taken him 10 minutes to finish the candies in the jar. Had Q eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar. Since both of them are eating simultaneously, how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar? ['A)4', 'B)5', 'C)6', 'D)7', 'E)8']",5,"Let's denote the rate at which P eats candies as \(P\) and the rate at which Q eats candies as \(Q\).   From the information given, we know that: 1. \(P = \frac{1}{10}\) (P takes 10 minutes to finish the jar alone) 2. \(Q = \frac{1}{5}\) (Q takes 5 minutes to finish half the jar alone)  When they eat together, their rates add up, so the combined rate is \(P + Q = \frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{10} + \frac{2}{10} = \frac{3}{10}\).  Therefore, it will take them \(\frac{1}{\frac{3}{10}} = \frac{10}{3} = 3\frac{1}{3}\) minutes to empty the jar.  # \(3\frac{1}{3}\)",,3.0
"A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make? ['A)125', 'B)150', 'C)225', 'D)250', 'E)275']",125,"Let's first calculate the cost of one bag of ice for the grocery store. Since the store makes a 20% profit on each bag of ice, the selling price is 120% of the cost price.  Let the cost price of one bag of ice be $x. Then, the selling price is $1.25.  So, $1.25 = 1.2x x = $1.25 / 1.2 x = $1.04  Therefore, the cost price of one bag of ice is $1.04.  The profit made on one bag of ice is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $1.25 - $1.04 = $0.21.  Total profit made by selling 500 bags of ice is 500 bags * $0.21/bag = $105.  # $105",,105.0
