"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower.

When the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60°, the car has traveled a horizontal distance $x$ such that $\tan(60^\circ) = \frac{h}{d+x}$ and $\tan(45^\circ) = \frac{h}{d}$.   Solving these equations, we get $d = h(\sqrt{3} - 1)$ and $x = h(\sqrt{3} + 1)$.   The time taken to cover distance $x$ is 10 minutes.   Now, the total distance to be covered by the car is $d$, which is $h(\sqrt{3} - 1)$.   Let the car take $t$ more minutes to reach the base of the tower.   The speed of the car is constant, so the time taken to cover a certain distance is directly proportional to the distance.   Therefore, $\frac{t}{10} = \frac{h(\sqrt{3} - 1)}{h(\sqrt{3} + 1)}$.   Solving for $t$, we get $t = 10\left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3} + 1}\right)$.   Calculating this expression, we get $t = 10\left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3} + 1}\right) = 10\left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3} + 1}\right) \times \frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3} - 1} = 10\left(\frac{3 - 2\sqrt{3} + 1}{2}\right) = 10\left(\frac{4 - 2\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = 10(2 - \sqrt{3}) = 20 - 10\sqrt{3}$.

So, after the first 20 marbles were pulled out, the bag contained $x+20$ black marbles and $Q-x-20$ white marbles.  When the second set of 20 marbles was pulled out, 1 of them was black.

Given that: - $\frac{1}{16}x$ students study math, - $\frac{1}{10}x$ students study bio, - $\frac{1}{8}x$ students study English.  To find the minimum number of students, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 16, 10, and 8, which is 80. This means the total number of students $x$ must be a multiple of 80.  The minimum number of students is when $x = 80$, and the number of students studying each subject is: - Math: $\frac{1}{16} \times 80 = 5$ students, - Bio: $\frac{1}{10} \times 80 = 8$ students, - English: $\frac{1}{8} \times 80 = 10$ students.  So, the minimum number of students is $80 + 5 + 8 + 10 = 103$.  To find the maximum number of students, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 16, 10, and 8, which is 2. This means the total number of students $x$ must be a multiple of 2.  The maximum number of students is when $x = 9998$ (the largest 4-digit number divisible by 2), and the number of students studying each subject is: - Math: $\frac{1}{16} \times 9998 = 624.875$ students (round up to 625), - Bio: $\frac{1}{10} \times 9998 = 999.8$ students (round up to 1000), - English: $\frac{1}{8} \times 9998 = 1249.75$ students (round up to 1250).  So, the maximum number of students is $9998 + 625 + 1000 + 1250 = 12873$.  The difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is $12873 - 103 = 12770$.  # Answer  12770",,12770.0

We are given that $|C \cap S| = 24\%$ of all students, which means $|C \cap S| = 0.24|D|$.  We are also given that $|S - C| = 20\%$ of the swim team members are not members of the chess club. This implies that $|S - C| = 0.20|S|$.  From the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we know that: $|C \cup S| = |C| + |S| - |C \cap S|$  Since $|C \cap S| = 0.24|D|$ and $|C \cup S| = |D|$, we have: $|D| = |C| + |S| - 0.24|D|$  Rearranging the equation, we get: $|S| = 0.76|D| - |C|$  Given that $|S - C| = 0.20|S|$, we can rewrite this as: $|S| - |C \cap S| = 0.20|S|$  Substitute $|S| = 0.76|D| - |C|$ into the equation above: $0.76|D| - |C| - 0.24|D| = 0.20(0.76|D| - |C|)$  Solving for $|C|$, we get: $0.76|D| - |C| - 0.24|D| = 0.152|D| - 0.20|C|$ $0.52|D| = 0.80|C|$ $|C| = 0.65|D|$  Therefore, the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the chess club is $65\%$.

Case 1: The man arrives between 5:00 A.M. and 5:02 A.M. In this case, the man will definitely catch the first train, which is the main line train at 5:00 A.M.  Case 2: The man arrives between 5:02 A.M. and 5:10 A.M. In this case, the man will catch the harbor line train at 5:02 A.M.

According to the information given, the population of Boomtown one year ago was $P/(1+0.10) = P/1.10$.  The population of Boomtown two years from now is expected to be double the population of one year ago, so it will be $2 \times \left(\frac{P}{1.10}\right)$.  Therefore, the population of Boomtown two years from now is $2 \times \left(\frac{P}{1.10}\right) = \frac{2P}{1.10}$.  Since this population is expected to be the population two years from now, we can set this equal to the population two years from now if the population increased by 10% each year. This gives us the equation:  $\frac{2P}{1.10} = P \times (1+0.10)^2$  Solving this equation will give us the value of $P$, the current population of Boomtown.  $\frac{2P}{1.10} = P \times 1.21$  $2P = 1.21P \times 1.10$  $2P = 1.331P$  $P = \frac{2P}{1.331}$  $P \approx 1.501P$  Therefore, the current population of Boomtown is approximately 1.501 times the population two years ago.

The ages of the members form an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 3 months. The youngest member is 7 years old, so the ages of the members can be represented as: 7, 7 years 3 months, 7 years 6 months, and so on.  The sum of an arithmetic progression can be calculated using the formula:  $$\text{Sum} = \frac{n}{2} \times (2a + (n-1)d)$$ where $n$ is the number of terms, $a$ is the first term, and $d$ is the common difference.  Given that the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, we have: $$250 = \frac{n}{2} \times (2 \times 7 + (n-1) \times 3)$$ Simplifying this equation gives: $$250 = \frac{n}{2} \times (14 + 3n - 3)$$ $$250 = \frac{n}{2} \times (11 + 3n)$$ $$500 = n(11 + 3n)$$ $$500 = 11n + 3n^2$$ $$3n^2 + 11n - 500 = 0$$  Now, we need to solve this quadratic equation to find the number of members in the club. We can use the quadratic formula: $$n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$ where $a = 3$, $b = 11$, and $c = -500$.  Calculating the values gives: $$n = \frac{-11 \pm \sqrt{11^2 - 4 \times 3 \times -500}}{2 \times 3}$$ $$n = \frac{-11 \pm \sqrt{121 + 600}}{6}$$ $$n = \frac{-11 \pm \sqrt{721}}{6}$$  Since the number of members must be a positive integer, we take the positive root: $$n = \frac{-11 + \sqrt{721}}{6}$$ $$n \approx 18.45$$  Therefore, the number of members in the club is approximately 18.45, which means there are 18 members in the club.  # Answer  18",,18.0

From the information given, we know that the space shuttle takes 5 seconds to pass a point, so in 5 seconds it travels a distance of $L$ meters. This gives us the equation $5v = L$.  We are also told that at its maximum speed, the space shuttle can travel 700 meters high in 40 seconds. This gives us the equation $40v = 700$.  Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the length of the space shuttle.  From the first equation, we have $v = \frac{L}{5}$.  Substitute this into the second equation:  $40\left(\frac{L}{5}\right) = 700$  $8L = 700$  $L = \frac{700}{8}$  $L = 87.5$  Therefore, the length of the space shuttle is 87.5 meters.  # Answer  87.5",,87.5

The profit sharing ratio is based on the product of the investment and the time for which they invested their money.   The profit sharing ratio of A, B, and C can be calculated as follows: A's investment * 12 : B's investment * (12 - 2) : C's investment * (12 - t) = 40000 * 12 : 60000 * 10 : 120000 * (12 - t)  Solving this equation, we get: 480000 : 600000 : 1440000 - 120000t = 4 : 5 : 15  Multiplying each ratio by a factor to make the ratio of C's share equal to 150000, we get: 480000 * 15 : 600000 * 15 : 1440000 - 120000t * 15 = 4 * 15 : 5 * 15 : 15 * 15  Solving this equation, we get: 7200000 : 9000000 : 21600000 - 1800000t = 60 : 75 : 225  Since C's share is 150000, we can write: 21600000 - 1800000t = 225  Solving for t, we get: 1800000t = 21487500 t = 11.9375  Therefore, C joined the business approximately 12 months after B joined.  # C joined the business 12 months after B joined.",,12.0

The radius of the semicircle is half of the diameter, so the radius is 10 cm.  The area of a semicircle is given by the formula: Area_semicircle = (1/2) * π * radius²  For one semicircle, the area is: Area_semicircle = (1/2) * π * 10 cm * 10 cm = 50π cm²  Since there are two semicircles, the total area of the two semicircles is: Total_area_semicircles = 2 * 50π cm² = 100π cm²  Now, the area of the remaining paper after cutting out the two semicircles is: Remaining_area = Area_square - Total_area_semicircles Remaining_area = 400 cm² - 100π cm²  To get the numerical value, we can use the approximation π ≈ 3.14: Remaining_area ≈ 400 cm² - 100 * 3.14 cm² Remaining_area ≈ 400 cm² - 314 cm² Remaining_area ≈ 86 cm²  Therefore, the area of the remaining paper is approximately 86 cm².  # 86 cm²",,86.0

"For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought? ['A)4', 'B)3', 'C)2', 'D)1', 'E)0']",2,"Let's denote the number of copper coins as $x$ and the number of brass coins as $y$.   Given that the diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin, we can write the total earnings equation as: $0.20x + 0.25y = 3.40$  We also know that the total number of coins brought up is the sum of copper and brass coins: $x + y = \text{total number of coins}$  Since the total number of coins is not given, we need to find a way to express the total number of coins in terms of $x$ and $y$. We can do this by solving the system of equations.  First, let's rewrite the total earnings equation in terms of $y$: $0.25y = 3.40 - 0.20x$ $y = \frac{3.40 - 0.20x}{0.25}$  Substitute this expression for $y$ into the equation $x + y = \text{total number of coins}$: $x + \frac{3.40 - 0.20x}{0.25} = \text{total number of coins}$ $0.25x + 3.40 - 0.20x = 0.25 \times \text{total number of coins}$ $0.05x = 0.25 \times \text{total number of coins} - 3.40$ $x = 5 \times (\text{total number of coins}) - 68$  Since the number of coins must be a whole number, we can see that $x$ must be a multiple of 5. The minimum value of $x$ that satisfies this condition is $x = 5$.  Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins that the diver brought is 5.  # Answer  5",,5.0

From the given information, we know that Neha is 12th from the left end and Radha is 6th from the right end. Therefore, the number of children between Neha and Radha is $x - 12 - 6 = x - 18$.  When Radha is shifted to the left by 2 places, she becomes 4th from the right end. Similarly, when Neha is shifted to the right by 2 places, she becomes 14th from the left end. Now, there are 6 children between Radha and Neha.  This means that the number of children between Radha and Neha after shifting is $14 - 4 - 1 = 9$. But we are also given that there are 6 children between them. So, we have $x - 18 = 6$.  Solving the equation $x - 18 = 6$, we get $x = 24$.

Given that the man spent a total of 810, we can write the equation: $70x + 30y = 810$  To maximize the number of trousers bought, we need to maximize $x$. Since the cost of each trouser is higher than the cost of each shirt, we should buy as many trousers as possible while still spending the entire 810.  Let's find the maximum number of trousers that can be bought. Since each trouser costs 70, the maximum number of trousers that can be bought is $\left\lfloor\frac{810}{70}\right\rfloor = 11$.  Now, let's substitute $x = 11$ into the equation $70x + 30y = 810$ to find the corresponding number of shirts: $70(11) + 30y = 810$ $770 + 30y = 810$ $30y = 40$ $y = \frac{40}{30} = \frac{4}{3}$  Since the number of shirts must be a whole number, we cannot buy a fraction of a shirt.

Given: L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]  Let's first simplify the expressions: 1. [x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to x.

To compare L(x,y) and R(x,y), we need to consider the possible values of n, m, p, q, and r.

This means the amount of orange juice in the final mixture should be 60% of the total volume, which is $0.6x$ gallons.  Since we already have $0.4x$ gallons of orange juice in the soft drink, we need to add $0.6x - 0.4x = 0.2x$ gallons of orange juice to reach the desired 60% concentration.  Therefore, the additional gallons of orange juice needed is $0.2x$. To find the value of $x$, we can set up an equation based on the total volume of the soft drink:  $0.4x + 0.2x = x$  Solving for $x$:  $0.6x = x$  $0.6x - 0.6x = x - 0.6x$  $0 = 0.4x$  $x = 0$  This implies that the total amount of soft drink needed is 0 gallons, which doesn't make sense.

['A)11', 'B)10', 'C)9', 'D)8', 'E)7']",11,"Let's consider the total number of ways to select 2 balls from n balls, which is given by the combination formula $\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n!}{2!(n-2)!} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.  Now, we are given that there are 45 different ways to select 2 balls such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected. This means that out of the total $\binom{n}{2}$ ways, we need to subtract the ways where the ball with number 3 is selected.  The number of ways to select 2 balls where the ball with number 3 is selected is $\binom{n-1}{1} = n-1$ (since we have to choose one ball from the remaining n-1 balls after excluding the ball with number 3).  Therefore, the number of ways to select 2 balls such that the ball with number 3 is not selected is $\binom{n}{2} - (n-1) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} - (n-1)$.  Given that this expression equals 45, we have:  $\frac{n(n-1)}{2} - (n-1) = 45$  Solving this equation will give us the value of n. Let's solve it:  $\frac{n(n-1)}{2} - (n-1) = 45$  $\frac{n^2 - n}{2} - n + 1 = 45$  $n^2 - n - 2n + 2 = 90$  $n^2 - 3n - 88 = 0$  Factoring the quadratic equation gives:  $(n-11)(n+8) = 0$  So, n = 11 or n = -8.

['A)37', 'B)38', 'C)36', 'D)30', 'E)39']",39,"Let's denote the three consecutive integers as \(n-1\), \(n\), and \(n+1\). The product of these three integers is given by \((n-1) \times n \times (n+1)\).  Given that the product can be expressed as \(727 + 728 + 729\), we have:  \[(n-1) \times n \times (n+1) = 727 + 728 + 729\]  Simplifying the right side:  \[727 + 728 + 729 = 2184\]  So, we have:  \[n^3 - n = 2184\]  \[n(n^2 - 1) = 2184\]  \[n(n+1)(n-1) = 2184\]  Now, we need to find the three consecutive integers whose product is 2184. We can start by finding the prime factorization of 2184:  \[2184 = 2^3 \times 3 \times 7 \times 13\]  Since we are looking for three consecutive integers, we can see that \(2 \times 3 \times 4 = 24\) is close to 2184. Let's check if 24 is a factor of 2184:  \[2184 \div 24 = 91\]  So, the three consecutive integers are 91, 92, and 93.  Now, the sum of these three consecutive integers is:  \[91 + 92 + 93 = 276\]  Therefore, the sum of three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727 + 728 + 729 is 276.  # Answer  276",,276.0
"The capacity of a tank of dimensions (8 m × 6 m × 2.5 m) is ['A)120 litres', 'B)1200 litres', 'C)12000 litres', 'D)120000 litres', 'E)None of these']",120000 litres,"To find the capacity of the tank, we need to calculate the volume of the tank.  The volume of a rectangular tank is given by the formula:  \[ \text{Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} \]  Given: Length = 8 m Width = 6 m Height = 2.5 m  Plugging in the values: \[ \text{Volume} = 8 \, \text{m} \times 6 \, \text{m} \times 2.5 \, \text{m} \]  \[ \text{Volume} = 120 \, \text{m}^3 \]  Now, we need to convert cubic meters to liters. Since 1 cubic meter is equal to 1000 liters, we have: \[ \text{Volume in liters} = 120 \times 1000 \, \text{liters} \]  \[ \text{Volume in liters} = 120000 \, \text{liters} \]  Therefore, the capacity of the tank is 120000 liters.  #  120000 litres",,120000.0

Number of children = Total population - Number of adults Number of children = 5265526 - 4169516 Number of children = 1096010  Therefore, the number of children in the city is 1096010.  #1096010",,1096010.0
"It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour. How many minutes will it take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour? ['A)30', 'B)32', 'C)35', 'D)36', 'E)40']",30,"To find the time it takes for the worker to cycle from home to work at 6 kilometers per hour, we first need to calculate the distance between home and work.  Given that the worker drives from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour and it takes 9 minutes, we can use the formula:  \[ \text{distance} = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \]  \[ \text{distance} = 20 \times \frac{9}{60} \]  \[ \text{distance} = 3 \]  So, the distance between home and work is 3 kilometers.  Now, to find the time it takes for the worker to cycle from home to work at 6 kilometers per hour, we use the formula:  \[ \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \]  \[ \text{time} = \frac{3}{6} \]  \[ \text{time} = \frac{1}{2} \]  Converting this to minutes:  \[ \text{time} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 \]  \[ \text{time} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]  Therefore, it will take the worker 30 minutes to cycle from home to work at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour.  # Answer  # 30",,30.0
"Two friends are eating a jar full of candies. Had P eaten alone, it would have taken him 10 minutes to finish the candies in the jar. Had Q eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar. Since both of them are eating simultaneously, how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar? ['A)4', 'B)5', 'C)6', 'D)7', 'E)8']",5,"Let's denote the rate at which P eats candies as \(P\) and the rate at which Q eats candies as \(Q\).   From the information given, we know that: 1. \(P = \frac{1}{10}\) (P takes 10 minutes to finish the jar alone) 2. \(Q = \frac{1}{5}\) (Q takes 5 minutes to finish half the jar, so she takes 10 minutes to finish the whole jar alone)  When they eat together, their rates add up, so the combined rate is \(P + Q = \frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{10} + \frac{2}{10} = \frac{3}{10}\).  Therefore, it will take them \(\frac{1}{\frac{3}{10}} = \frac{10}{3} = 3\frac{1}{3}\) minutes to empty the jar.  # \(3\frac{1}{3}\)",,3.0
"A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make? ['A)125', 'B)150', 'C)225', 'D)250', 'E)275']",125,"Let's first calculate the cost of one bag of ice for the grocery store. Since the store makes a 20% profit on each bag of ice, the selling price is 120% of the cost price.  Let the cost price of one bag of ice be $x. Then, the selling price is 1.2x.  Given that the selling price is $1.25, we have:  1.2x = 1.25  Solving for x:  x = 1.25 / 1.2 x = 1.041666...  So, the cost price of one bag of ice is approximately $1.04.  Now, the profit made on one bag of ice is:  Profit per bag = Selling price - Cost price Profit per bag = $1.25 - $1.04 Profit per bag = $0.21  Therefore, the total profit made by selling 500 bags of ice is:  Total profit = Profit per bag * Number of bags sold Total profit = $0.21 * 500 Total profit = $105  # $105",,105.0
