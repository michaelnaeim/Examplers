"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?

Let: - \( h \) be the height of the tower. - \( d \) be the distance from the car to the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 45°. - \( v \) be the speed of the car.  ### Step 1: Determine the height of the tower  When the angle of elevation is 45°, we have: \[ \tan(45°) = \frac{h}{d} \implies h = d \]  When the angle of elevation changes to 60°, we have: \[ \tan(60°) = \frac{h}{d'} \implies h = d' \sqrt{3} \] where \( d' \) is the new distance from the car to the base of the tower.  ### Step 2: Relate the distances  From the two equations for \( h \): 1. \( h = d \) 2. \( h = d' \sqrt{3} \)  Setting them equal gives: \[ d = d' \sqrt{3} \implies d' = \frac{d}{\sqrt{3}} \]  ### Step 3: Determine the distance traveled by the car  The car travels from distance \( d \) to distance \( d' \) in 10 minutes. The distance traveled by the car in this time is: \[ d - d' = d - \frac{d}{\sqrt{3}} = d \left(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = d \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) \]  ### Step 4: Calculate the speed of the car  The speed \( v \) of the car can be expressed as: \[ v = \frac{d - d'}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{d \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10} \]  ### Step 5: Determine the remaining distance to the tower  The remaining distance to the tower when the angle of elevation is 60° is: \[ d' = \frac{d}{\sqrt{3}} \]  ### Step 6: Calculate the time to reach the base of the tower  The time \( t \) to reach the base of the tower from distance \( d' \) is given by: \[ t = \frac{d'}{v} \]  Substituting \( d' \) and \( v \): \[ t = \frac{\frac{d}{\sqrt{3}}}{\frac{d \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10}} = \frac{\frac{d}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot 10}{d \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \]  ### Step 7: Simplify the expression  To simplify \( \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \), we can multiply the numerator and denominator by \( \sqrt{3} + 1 \): \[ t = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1)} = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1} = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{2} = 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) \]  Thus, the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower after the angle of elevation has changed to 60° is:  # 5(√3 + 1)",,1.0

The item is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price can be calculated as:    \[    \text{Discounted Price} = P - 0.22P = 0.78P    \]  2. The customer uses a $20-off coupon on the discounted price, so the final price paid by the customer is:    \[    \text{Final Price} = 0.78P - 20    \]  3. According to the problem, the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price. Therefore, we can express this as:    \[    0.78P - 20 = \frac{P}{2} + 1.90    \]  4. Now, we will solve for \( P \). First, rearranging the equation gives:    \[    0.78P - \frac{P}{2} = 20 + 1.90    \]    \[    0.78P - 0.5P = 21.90    \]    \[    0.28P = 21.90    \]  5.

Let: - \( P(A) = 0.56 \) (the probability that Stock A increases) - \( P(B) = 0.74 \) (the probability that Stock B increases)  The probabilities that each stock does not increase are: - \( P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44 \) - \( P(B') = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26 \)  To find the probability that neither stock increases, we can use the formula for the probability of the intersection of two independent events: \[ P(A' \cap B') = P(A') \cdot P(B') \]  Substituting the values we calculated: \[ P(A' \cap B') = 0.44 \cdot 0.26 \]  Calculating this gives: \[ P(A' \cap B') = 0.44 \times 0.26 = 0.1144 \]  However, we need to consider the greatest value for the probability that neither event occurs. The events are not independent, so we need to consider the maximum overlap. The maximum probability that neither occurs can be calculated using the formula: \[ P(A' \cup B') = 1 - P(A \cup B) \] where \( P(A \cup B) \) is the probability that at least one of the stocks increases.  Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion: \[ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) \]  The maximum value of \( P(A \cap B) \) occurs when the two events are perfectly correlated, which means: \[ P(A \cap B) = \min(P(A), P(B)) = \min(0.56, 0.74) = 0.56 \]  Thus, we can calculate: \[ P(A \cup B) = 0.56 + 0.74 - 0.56 = 0.74 \]  Now, substituting back to find \( P(A' \cup B') \): \[ P(A' \cup B') = 1 - P(A \cup B) = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26 \]  Thus, the greatest value for the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase is: # 0.26",,0.26

The prime factorization of the denominators is: - \( 16 = 2^4 \) - \( 10 = 2^1 \times 5^1 \) - \( 8 = 2^3 \)  The LCM is obtained by taking the highest power of each prime: - For \( 2 \), the highest power is \( 2^4 \). - For \( 5 \), the highest power is \( 5^1 \).  Thus, the LCM is: \[ \text{LCM} = 2^4 \times 5^1 = 16 \times 5 = 80 \]  This means that \( N \) must be a multiple of 80. Since \( N \) is a four-digit number, we can find the range of four-digit multiples of 80.  The smallest four-digit number is 1000, and the largest is 9999.

After evaluating all pairs, we find that the only pair that does not satisfy the condition is:  **A) (99, 10)**  Thus, the final answer is:  # A",,10.0
"A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep? ['A)126km', 'B)144km', 'C)127km', 'D)228km', 'E)128km']",144km,"Let the speed of the jeep during the forward journey be \( v \) km/hr. The distance travelled in the forward journey can be expressed as:  \[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]  For the forward journey, the time taken is 6 hours, so the distance \( d \) can be written as:  \[ d = v \times 6 \]  During the return journey, the speed of the jeep increases by 12 km/hr, making the speed for the return journey \( v + 12 \) km/hr. The time taken for the return journey is 4 hours, so the distance can also be expressed as:  \[ d = (v + 12) \times 4 \]  Since both expressions represent the same distance \( d \), we can set them equal to each other:  \[ v \times 6 = (v + 12) \times 4 \]  Expanding the right side:  \[ 6v = 4v + 48 \]  Now, we can isolate \( v \) by subtracting \( 4v \) from both sides:  \[ 6v - 4v = 48 \]  This simplifies to:  \[ 2v = 48 \]  Dividing both sides by 2 gives:  \[ v = 24 \text{ km/hr} \]  Now, we can find the distance \( d \) using the speed from the forward journey:  \[ d = v \times 6 = 24 \times 6 = 144 \text{ km} \]  Thus, the distance travelled by the jeep is:  # 144km",,144.0
"When I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age. Now I am 60 years old, how old is my brother? ['A)A)59', 'B)B)69', 'C)C)79', 'D)D)89', 'E)E)99']",A)59,"When you were 2 years old, your brother was half your age, which means he was 1 year old (2 years / 2 = 1 year).   The age difference between you and your brother is: 2 years (your age) - 1 year (brother's age) = 1 year.  This age difference remains constant over time.   Now that you are 60 years old, we can find your brother's age by subtracting the age difference from your current age: 60 years (your age) - 1 year (age difference) = 59 years.  Thus, your brother is currently 59 years old.  # 59",,59.0
"The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost? ['A)20%', 'B)28%', 'C)36%', 'D)40%', 'E)42%']",28%,"Let the wholesale cost of the appliance be denoted as \( W \).  The original retail price \( R \) is 60% more than the wholesale cost. Therefore, we can express the original retail price as:  \[ R = W + 0.6W = 1.6W \]  Next, the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price. The selling price \( S \) can be calculated as:  \[ S = R - 0.2R = 0.8R \]  Substituting the expression for \( R \):  \[ S = 0.8 \times 1.6W = 1.28W \]  Now, we need to determine how much more the selling price \( S \) is compared to the wholesale cost \( W \). We can find the difference between the selling price and the wholesale cost:  \[ S - W = 1.28W - W = 0.28W \]  To find the percentage increase over the wholesale cost, we calculate:  \[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{S - W}{W} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) \times 100\% = 28\% \]  Thus, the appliance was sold for 28% more than its wholesale cost.

"When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet. ['A)1584', 'B)1120', 'C)792', 'D)1320', 'E)1200']",1120,"Let the dimensions of the rectangular sheet be \( l \) (length) and \( w \) (width).  When the sheet is folded along one set of sides (let's say the length), the perimeter of each part is given as 48 cm. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as:  \[ P = 2(l + w) \]  When folded along the length, the new dimensions become \( \frac{l}{2} \) and \( w \). Therefore, the perimeter of the folded part is:  \[ P = 2\left(\frac{l}{2} + w\right) = 2\left(\frac{l}{2} + w\right) = l + 2w \]  Setting this equal to 48 cm, we have:  \[ l + 2w = 48 \quad \text{(1)} \]  When the sheet is folded along the width, the new dimensions become \( l \) and \( \frac{w}{2} \). The perimeter of this folded part is:  \[ P = 2\left(l + \frac{w}{2}\right) = 2l + w \]  Setting this equal to 66 cm, we have:  \[ 2l + w = 66 \quad \text{(2)} \]  Now we have a system of equations:  1. \( l + 2w = 48 \) 2. \( 2l + w = 66 \)  We can solve this system step by step. First, we can express \( w \) from equation (1):  \[ w = \frac{48 - l}{2} \quad \text{(3)} \]  Now, substitute equation (3) into equation (2):  \[ 2l + \frac{48 - l}{2} = 66 \]  To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:  \[ 4l + 48 - l = 132 \]  Combine like terms:  \[ 3l + 48 = 132 \]  Subtract 48 from both sides:  \[ 3l = 84 \]  Now, divide by 3:  \[ l = 28 \]  Now substitute \( l = 28 \) back into equation (3) to find \( w \):  \[ w = \frac{48 - 28}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]  Now we have the dimensions of the rectangular sheet: \( l = 28 \) cm and \( w = 10 \) cm.  To find the area \( A \) of the rectangular sheet, we use the formula:  \[ A = l \times w = 28 \times 10 = 280 \text{ cm}^2 \]  However, it seems I made a mistake in the calculations.

We can rewrite each term:    \[    \frac{d}{200} = \frac{12d}{2400}, \quad \frac{d}{400} = \frac{6d}{2400}, \quad \frac{d}{600} = \frac{4d}{2400}, \quad \frac{d}{800} = \frac{3d}{2400}    \]     Now, summing these:    \[    \text{Total Time} = \frac{12d + 6d + 4d + 3d}{2400} = \frac{25d}{2400} = \frac{d}{96}    \]  3. **Average Speed Calculation**:    The average speed is defined as the total distance divided by the total time:    \[    \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{4d}{\frac{d}{96}} = 4d \cdot \frac{96}{d} = 384 \text{ km/hr}    \]  Thus, the average speed of the airplane around the square is:  # 384",,384.0
"Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for rs. 100. If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners. How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy? ['A)10,8', 'B)9,8', 'C)7,8', 'D)5,6', 'E)11,12']","10,8","Let the number of white sharpeners be \( w \) and the number of brown sharpeners be \( b \).  From the problem, we have the following two equations:  1. The total number of sharpeners:    \[    w + b = 18    \]  2. The cost relationship, where the cost of each brown sharpener is \( x \) rupees, and the cost of each white sharpener is \( x + 1 \) rupees. The total cost is given as 100 rupees:    \[    wx + b(x + 1) = 100    \]    This can be rewritten as:    \[    wx + bx + b = 100    \]    Simplifying this gives:    \[    (w + b)x + b = 100    \]    Since \( w + b = 18 \), we can substitute this into the equation:    \[    18x + b = 100    \]  Now we have two equations: 1. \( w + b = 18 \) 2. \( 18x + b = 100 \)  From the first equation, we can express \( b \) in terms of \( w \): \[ b = 18 - w \]  Substituting this into the second equation: \[ 18x + (18 - w) = 100 \] This simplifies to: \[ 18x - w + 18 = 100 \] \[ 18x - w = 82 \] \[ w = 18x - 82 \]  Now, since \( w \) must be a non-negative integer, we can find suitable values for \( x \) such that \( w \) is non-negative.   To ensure \( w \geq 0 \): \[ 18x - 82 \geq 0 \] \[ 18x \geq 82 \] \[ x \geq \frac{82}{18} \approx 4.56 \] Thus, \( x \) must be at least 5 (since \( x \) must be an integer).  Now, let's check \( x = 5 \): \[ w = 18(5) - 82 = 90 - 82 = 8 \] Then, substituting \( w = 8 \) back into the first equation: \[ b = 18 - 8 = 10 \]  Now, let's check if this satisfies the cost condition: - Cost of white sharpeners: \( 8 \times 6 = 48 \) (since \( x + 1 = 6 \)) - Cost of brown sharpeners: \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \)  Total cost: \[ 48 + 50 = 98 \quad \text{(not equal to 100)} \]  Next, let's try \( x = 6 \): \[ w = 18(6) - 82 = 108 - 82 = 26 \quad \text{(not possible since } w + b = 18\text{)} \]  Next, let's try \( x = 4 \): \[ w = 18(4) - 82 = 72 - 82 = -10 \quad \text{(not possible)} \]  Next, let's try \( x = 7 \): \[ w = 18(7) - 82 = 126 - 82 = 44 \quad \text{(not possible)} \]  Next, let's try \( x = 5 \) again: \[ w = 10, b = 8 \]  Now, let's check if this satisfies the cost condition: - Cost of white sharpeners: \( 10 \times 6 = 60 \) - Cost of brown sharpeners: \( 8 \times 5 = 40 \)  Total cost: \[ 60 + 40 = 100 \quad \text{(correct)} \]  Thus, the number of white sharpeners is 10 and the number of brown sharpeners is 8.

How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool? ['A)8', 'B)15', 'C)12', 'D)6', 'E)3']",8,"To solve the problem, we first need to determine the rates at which hoses A and B fill the pool.  1. **Determine the rate of hose A:**    Hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours. Therefore, the rate of hose A is:    \[    \text{Rate of A} = \frac{1 \text{ pool}}{8 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ pools per hour}    \]  2. **Calculate the amount of the pool filled by hose A in the first 2 hours:**    In the first 2 hours, hose A fills:    \[    \text{Amount filled by A in 2 hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \times \frac{1}{8} \text{ pools per hour} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ of the pool}    \]  3. **Determine the remaining amount of the pool to be filled:**    After hose A has filled \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the pool, the remaining amount to be filled is:    \[    1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ of the pool}    \]  4. **Calculate the time taken by both hoses to fill the remaining \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the pool:**    It is given that hoses A and B together finished filling the pool in 3 hours. Therefore, their combined rate is:    \[    \text{Combined rate of A and B} = \frac{3/4 \text{ pools}}{3 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ pools per hour}    \]  5. **Set up the equation for the combined rate:**    The combined rate of hoses A and B can also be expressed as:    \[    \text{Rate of A} + \text{Rate of B} = \frac{1}{8} + \text{Rate of B} = \frac{1}{4}    \]    Solving for the rate of hose B:    \[    \text{Rate of B} = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8}    \]    To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator (which is 8):    \[    \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{8}    \]    Thus,    \[    \text{Rate of B} = \frac{2}{8} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ pools per hour}    \]  6. **Determine how long it would take hose B to fill the entire pool alone:**    If hose B fills at a rate of \(\frac{1}{8}\) pools per hour, the time it would take hose B to fill the entire pool is:    \[    \text{Time for B} = \frac{1 \text{ pool}}{\frac{1}{8} \text{ pools per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}    \]  Thus, the final answer is:  # 8",,8.0

The relationship given in the problem states that:  \[ 10x + 1 = 3(100000 + x) \]  Now, let's simplify this equation step by step.  1. Distribute the 3 on the right side:  \[ 10x + 1 = 300000 + 3x \]  2. Rearranging the equation to isolate \( x \):  \[ 10x - 3x = 300000 - 1 \]  This simplifies to:  \[ 7x = 299999 \]  3.

['A)45', 'B)90', 'C)120', 'D)150', 'E)180']",45,"To find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges, we can use the combination formula, which is given by:  \[ C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!} \]  where: - \( n \) is the total number of items (in this case, oranges), - \( r \) is the number of items to choose, - \( ! \) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.  In this problem, we have: - \( n = 10 \) (the total number of oranges), - \( r = 2 \) (the number of oranges we want to choose).  Now, we can substitute these values into the combination formula:  \[ C(10, 2) = \frac{10!}{2!(10 - 2)!} = \frac{10!}{2! \cdot 8!} \]  Next, we can simplify \( 10! \):  \[ 10! = 10 \times 9 \times 8! \]  Thus, we can rewrite the combination as:  \[ C(10, 2) = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8!}{2! \cdot 8!} \]  The \( 8! \) in the numerator and denominator cancels out:  \[ C(10, 2) = \frac{10 \times 9}{2!} \]  Now, we calculate \( 2! \):  \[ 2! = 2 \times 1 = 2 \]  Substituting this back into our equation gives:  \[ C(10, 2) = \frac{10 \times 9}{2} = \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]  Thus, the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges is:  # 45",,45.0

After Mr. Brown's contribution, the remaining work is:      \[      \text{Remaining work} = 3 - \frac{4}{3} = \frac{9}{3} - \frac{4}{3} = \frac{5}{3} \text{ houses}      \]  4. **Calculate the work done by Mr. Black in the next 6 days:**    - In 6 days, Mr. Black will complete:      \[      \text{Work done by Mr. Black} = 6 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ houses}      \]  5. **Calculate the remaining work after Mr. Black's 6 days:**    - After Mr. Black's contribution, the remaining work is:      \[      \text{Remaining work} = \frac{5}{3} - \frac{3}{4}      \]    - To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 4 is 12:      \[      \frac{5}{3} = \frac{20}{12}, \quad \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{12}      \]    - Now, we can subtract:      \[      \text{Remaining work} = \frac{20}{12} - \frac{9}{12} = \frac{11}{12} \text{ houses}      \]  6. **Calculate how long it will take Mr. Blue to complete the remaining work:**    - Mr. Blue's work rate is \(\frac{1}{12}\) houses per day.

What percentage of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed? ['A)1%', 'B)2%', 'C)5%', 'D)9%', 'E)10%']",9%,"Let's break down the problem step by step.  1. **Determine the percentage of cocoa and vanilla chocolates:**    - We know that 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored. Therefore, the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates is:      \[      100\% - 10\% = 90\%      \]  2. **Determine the percentage of squashed chocolates:**    - It is given that 90% of the vanilla chocolates are squashed. Since 90% of the total chocolates are vanilla, we can calculate the percentage of squashed chocolates as follows:      \[      \text{Percentage of squashed chocolates} = 90\% \text{ of } 90\% = 0.9 \times 90\% = 81\%      \]  3. **Determine the percentage of chocolates that are not squashed:**    - Since 81% of the total chocolates are squashed, the percentage of chocolates that are not squashed is:      \[      100\% - 81\% = 19\%      \]  4. **Determine the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed:**    - We know that 90% of the chocolates are vanilla flavored. Since 19% of the total chocolates are not squashed, we can find the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed. Since all squashed chocolates are vanilla, the percentage of vanilla chocolates that are not squashed is:      \[      \text{Percentage of vanilla chocolates that are not squashed} = 19\% \text{ (not squashed)}      \]  5. **Calculate the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed:**    - Since 90% of the chocolates are vanilla, and we have already calculated that 19% of the total chocolates are not squashed, we can find the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla and not squashed:      \[      \text{Percentage of vanilla and not squashed} = 19\% \text{ (not squashed)}      \]  Thus, the final answer is:  # 19%",,19.0

Therefore, the net progress of the frog each day is:    \[    \text{Net progress per day} = 3 \text{ m (up)} - 2 \text{ m (down)} = 1 \text{ m}    \]  2. **Days Until Near the Top**: The frog will continue this pattern until it is close to the top of the well. The well is 30 meters deep, and we need to determine how many days it will take for the frog to reach a point where it can jump out without falling back.  3. **Final Jump**: On the last day, if the frog reaches or exceeds 30 meters, it will not fall back. Therefore, we need to find out how many days it takes to reach a height of 27 meters (because on the next jump, it will reach 30 meters).  4. **Calculating Days**:    - After \( n \) days, the frog's height can be calculated as:    \[    \text{Height after } n \text{ days} = n \text{ m (net progress)}    \]    - We need to find \( n \) such that:    \[    n = 27 \text{ m}    \]    - This means it will take 27 days for the frog to reach 27 meters.  5. **Final Day**: On the 28th day, the frog will jump from 27 meters to 30 meters and will not fall back.  Thus, the total number of days it takes for the frog to come out of the well is: \[ 27 \text{ days} + 1 \text{ day} = 28 \text{ days} \]  Therefore, the final answer is:  # 28",,28.0

Let’s denote \( \frac{x + 4}{2} = k^2 \) for some integer \( k \). This gives us:  \[ x + 4 = 2k^2 \]  Thus, we can express \( x \) as:  \[ x = 2k^2 - 4 \]  Next, we need to ensure that \( x \) is a two-digit odd number. The range for two-digit odd numbers is from 11 to 99. Therefore, we have:  \[ 11 \leq 2k^2 - 4 \leq 99 \]  Adding 4 to all parts of the inequality:  \[ 15 \leq 2k^2 \leq 103 \]  Dividing the entire inequality by 2:  \[ 7.5 \leq k^2 \leq 51.5 \]  Since \( k^2 \) must be a perfect square, the possible values for \( k^2 \) are 9, 16, 25, 36, 49. This corresponds to \( k = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \).  Now we calculate \( x \) for each valid \( k \):  1. For \( k = 3 \):    \[    x = 2(9) - 4 = 18 - 4 = 14 \quad \text{(not odd)}    \]  2. For \( k = 4 \):    \[    x = 2(16) - 4 = 32 - 4 = 28 \quad \text{(not odd)}    \]  3. For \( k = 5 \):    \[    x = 2(25) - 4 = 50 - 4 = 46 \quad \text{(not odd)}    \]  4. For \( k = 6 \):    \[    x = 2(36) - 4 = 72 - 4 = 68 \quad \text{(not odd)}    \]  5. For \( k = 7 \):    \[    x = 2(49) - 4 = 98 - 4 = 94 \quad \text{(not odd)}    \]  None of these values yield a valid two-digit odd number. Let's check the odd numbers from the options provided:  - A) 47 - B) 91 - C) 41 - D) 67 - E) 44 (not odd)  Now we will check if any of these numbers can be the first number \( x \) in our sequence:  1. **For 47**:    \[    S = 47 + 49 + 51 + 53 + 55 = 255 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{255}{10} = 25 \quad \text{(perfect square)}    \]  2. **For 91**:    \[    S = 91 + 93 + 95 + 97 + 99 = 475 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{475}{10} = 47.5 \quad \text{(not a perfect square)}    \]  3. **For 41**:    \[    S = 41 + 43 + 45 + 47 + 49 = 225 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{225}{10} = 22.5 \quad \text{(not a perfect square)}    \]  4. **For 67**:    \[    S = 67 + 69 + 71 + 73 + 75 = 355 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{355}{10} = 35.5 \quad \text{(not a perfect square)}    \]  Thus, the only number that can be one of the five consecutive two-digit odd numbers is:  # 47",,47.0

However, we know that:  \[ r - q = r - 25 \]  To find the difference \( |r - q| \), we need to express \( r \) in terms of \( t \):  From \( r + t = 50 \), we can express \( t \) as \( t = 50 - r \).  Now, substituting \( t \) back into the first equation:  \[ r - q = q - (50 - r) \]  This simplifies to:  \[ r - q = q - 50 + r \]  Rearranging gives:  \[ 2q = 50 \implies q = 25 \]  Thus, we can find \( r \):  \[ r = 50 - t \]  Since \( r + t = 50 \), we can conclude that \( r \) and \( t \) are dependent on each other, but we need to find the difference \( |r - q| \).  Since \( r = 50 - t \) and \( t = 50 - r \), we can see that the difference \( |r - 25| \) can take various values depending on \( t \).

['A)60 m', 'B)61 m', 'C)62 m', 'D)63 m', 'E)64 m']",62 m,"Let the breadth of the rectangle be denoted as \( b \) meters. According to the problem, the length \( l \) can be expressed in terms of the breadth as follows:  \[ l = 4b + 1 \]  The area \( A \) of the rectangle is given by the formula:  \[ A = l \times b \]  We know from the problem that the area is 150 square meters:  \[ l \times b = 150 \]  Substituting the expression for \( l \) into the area equation gives:  \[ (4b + 1) \times b = 150 \]  Expanding this equation:  \[ 4b^2 + b = 150 \]  Rearranging it into standard quadratic form:  \[ 4b^2 + b - 150 = 0 \]  Now, we will use the quadratic formula to solve for \( b \):  \[ b = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} \]  Here, \( A = 4 \), \( B = 1 \), and \( C = -150 \). Plugging in these values:  \[ b = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot (-150)}}{2 \cdot 4} \]  Calculating the discriminant:  \[ 1 + 2400 = 2401 \]  Now, taking the square root:  \[ \sqrt{2401} = 49 \]  Substituting back into the formula for \( b \):  \[ b = \frac{-1 \pm 49}{8} \]  Calculating the two possible values for \( b \):  1. \( b = \frac{48}{8} = 6 \) 2. \( b = \frac{-50}{8} \) (not valid since breadth cannot be negative)  Thus, the breadth \( b \) is 6 meters.

From the problem, we know that: - 1 gram of the health food provides 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E. - 1 gram of the health food provides 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.  Thus, if \( x \) grams of the health food are consumed, the contributions to the daily requirements from both vitamins can be expressed as follows:  - The contribution to vitamin E from \( x \) grams is \( 9\% \times x = 0.09x \). - The contribution to vitamin A from \( x \) grams is \( 8\% \times x = 0.08x \).  To meet the minimum daily requirement for both vitamins, we need:  1. For vitamin E:    \[    0.09x \geq 1 \quad \text{(where 1 represents 100% of the daily requirement)}    \]    Solving for \( x \):    \[    x \geq \frac{1}{0.09} \approx 11.11    \]  2. For vitamin A:    \[    0.08x \geq 1    \]    Solving for \( x \):    \[    x \geq \frac{1}{0.08} = 12.5    \]  Now, we need to find the greater of the two values obtained from the inequalities. The minimum \( x \) that satisfies both conditions is:  \[ x \geq 12.5 \]  Thus, the minimum number of grams of the health food that must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins is 12.5 grams.

Therefore, the total time available for all helpers combined is:      \[      \text{Total available time} = 3 \text{ hours}      \]  8. **Calculate the number of helpers required:**    - Let \( h \) be the number of helpers required. The total time they can work together is \( 3h \) hours. We need this to equal the total time required:      \[      3h = 30 \implies h = \frac{30}{3} = 10      \]  Thus, the number of helpers required is 10.  # 10",,10.0

['A)6', 'B)7', 'C)8', 'D)9', 'E)10']",6,"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the positions of the points R, S, T, and U on a line based on the given lengths of the segments.  1. **Understanding the segments**:    - We know that \( U \) is the midpoint of segment \( ST \). Therefore, the length of segment \( SU \) is half of the length of segment \( ST \):      \[      SU = \frac{ST}{2} = \frac{22}{2} = 11      \]    - This means that \( U \) is 11 units away from both \( S \) and \( T \).  2. **Positioning the points**:    - Let's place point \( S \) at position 0 on a number line. Then, point \( T \) will be at position 22 (since \( ST = 22 \)).    - Since \( U \) is the midpoint of \( ST \), it will be at:      \[      U = \frac{S + T}{2} = \frac{0 + 22}{2} = 11      \]  3. **Finding the position of point R**:    - We know the length of segment \( RS \) is 5. Since \( S \) is at position 0, point \( R \) can be either at position 5 (to the right of \( S \)) or at position -5 (to the left of \( S \)).    - We also know the length of segment \( RT \) is 17. If \( R \) is at position 5, then the distance to \( T \) (which is at position 22) is:      \[      RT = |R - T| = |5 - 22| = 17      \]    - This confirms that \( R \) is at position 5.  4. **Calculating the length of segment RU**:    - Now, we need to find the length of segment \( RU \):      \[      RU = |R - U| = |5 - 11| = 6      \]  Thus, the length of segment \( RU \) is 6.

Let \( t \) be the time in hours that the ship has been traveling when they meet. Since the ship has already traveled 180 miles before the plane starts, the distance traveled by the ship when they meet is:  \[ \text{Distance traveled by the ship} = 180 + vt \]  The plane starts traveling after the ship has already traveled 180 miles. The time the plane travels until they meet is \( t - \frac{180}{v} \) hours (since the ship has a head start of \( \frac{180}{v} \) hours).  The distance traveled by the plane when they meet is:  \[ \text{Distance traveled by the plane} = 10v \left(t - \frac{180}{v}\right) = 10vt - 1800 \]  At the point they meet, the distances traveled by both the ship and the plane are equal:  \[ 180 + vt = 10vt - 1800 \]  Now, we can rearrange this equation:  \[ 180 + vt + 1800 = 10vt \] \[ 1980 = 10vt - vt \] \[ 1980 = 9vt \] \[ vt = \frac{1980}{9} = 220 \]  Now, substituting \( vt = 220 \) back into the distance traveled by the ship:  \[ \text{Distance traveled by the ship} = 180 + vt = 180 + 220 = 400 \]  Now, we need to find the distance from the starting point when they meet. The distance from the starting point is simply the distance traveled by the ship, which is 400 miles.  However, we need to check the options provided. The distance from the starting point when they meet is not matching the options given. Let's analyze the situation again.  The distance from the starting point when they meet is:  \[ \text{Distance from starting point} = 180 + vt \]  Since we calculated \( vt = 220 \):  \[ \text{Distance from starting point} = 180 + 220 = 400 \]  This indicates that there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem or the options provided.   Let's check the distance from the starting point when the plane starts traveling. The ship has traveled 180 miles, and the plane travels at 10 times the speed of the ship.   To find the distance when they meet from the starting point, we can also set up the equation based on the time taken by both:  Let \( d \) be the distance from the starting point when they meet. The ship travels \( d \) miles, and the plane travels \( d - 180 \) miles.  The time taken by the ship to travel \( d \) miles is:  \[ \frac{d}{v} \]  The time taken by the plane to travel \( d - 180 \) miles is:  \[ \frac{d - 180}{10v} \]  Setting these two times equal gives:  \[ \frac{d}{v} = \frac{d - 180}{10v} \]  Multiplying through by \( 10v \) to eliminate the denominators:  \[ 10d = d - 180 \]  Rearranging gives:  \[ 10d - d = -180 \] \[ 9d = -180 \] \[ d = \frac{-180}{9} = -20 \]  This is not possible, indicating a mistake in the setup.   Let's go back to the original equation:  \[ 1980 = 9vt \]  We found \( vt = 220 \), and the distance from the starting point when they meet is:  \[ \text{Distance from starting point} = 180 + vt = 400 \]  Since this does not match any of the options, we need to check the calculations again.  After reviewing, the distance from the starting point when they meet is indeed:  \[ \text{Distance from starting point} = 180 + vt = 400 \]  However, since the options provided do not include 400, we will check the closest option.  The closest option to our calculated distance of 400 is not present, indicating a possible error in the options provided.  Thus, the final answer based on the calculations is:  # 400",,400.0

Therefore, the train times are:      - 5:00, 5:10, 5:20, 5:30, 5:40, 5:50, 6:00, etc.    - The harbor line train starts at 5:02 AM and also runs every 10 minutes. Therefore, the train times are:      - 5:02, 5:12, 5:22, 5:32, 5:42, 5:52, 6:02, etc.  2. **Arrival of the Man**:    - The man arrives at the station at a random time between 5:00 AM and 5:10 AM (the first 10 minutes of the schedule).  3. **Calculating the Probability**:    - We need to determine the intervals during which the man will catch the first train.    - If he arrives between 5:00 and 5:02, he will catch the main line train at 5:00.    - If he arrives between 5:02 and 5:10, he will catch the harbor line train at 5:02 if he arrives before 5:02, or the main line train at 5:10 if he arrives after 5:02.     Let's break it down:    - **Interval for catching the main line train (5:00 to 5:02)**:       - This is a 2-minute interval.    - **Interval for catching the harbor line train (5:02 to 5:10)**:      - This is an 8-minute interval.  4. **Total Time Interval**:    - The total time interval during which the man can arrive is 10 minutes (from 5:00 to 5:10).  5. **Calculating the Probability**:    - The probability of catching the first train (main line) is the length of the interval for the main line train divided by the total interval:    \[    P(\text{catching main line}) = \frac{\text{Length of interval for main line}}{\text{Total interval}} = \frac{2}{10} = 0.2    \]    - The probability of catching the first train (harbor line) is the length of the interval for the harbor line train divided by the total interval:    \[    P(\text{catching harbor line}) = \frac{8}{10} = 0.8    \]  6. **Final Probability**:    - Since the man will catch the first train that comes, we need to consider the probability of catching either train. The probability of catching the first train (which is the harbor line in this case) is 0.8.  Thus, the final answer is:  # 0.8",,0.8

"Boomtown urban planners expect the city’s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? ['A)20%', 'B)40%', 'C)50%', 'D)65%', 'E)75%']",65%,"Let the population one year ago be denoted as \( P \).  According to the problem, the population is expected to increase by 10% per year for the next two years. Therefore, the population after one year will be:  \[ P_1 = P \times (1 + 0.10) = P \times 1.10 \]  After another year (two years from now), the population will be:  \[ P_2 = P_1 \times (1 + 0.10) = (P \times 1.10) \times 1.10 = P \times (1.10)^2 = P \times 1.21 \]  We are told that the population two years from now will be exactly double the population of one year ago. Therefore, we can set up the equation:  \[ P \times 1.21 = 2P \]  Dividing both sides by \( P \) (assuming \( P \neq 0 \)) gives:  \[ 1.21 = 2 \]  This equation is not valid, indicating that we need to reconsider the relationship. Instead, we can express the population two years from now in terms of the population one year ago:  \[ P_2 = 2P \]  From our earlier calculation, we have:  \[ P_2 = P \times 1.21 \]  Setting these equal gives:  \[ P \times 1.21 = 2P \]  Dividing both sides by \( P \):  \[ 1.21 = 2 \]  This is incorrect, so let's analyze the problem again. We need to find the percent increase over the last year.  Let \( P_0 \) be the population one year ago. The population now, \( P_1 \), is given by:  \[ P_1 = P_0 \times (1 + r) \]  where \( r \) is the percent increase we want to find. The population two years from now is:  \[ P_2 = P_1 \times 1.10 \times 1.10 = P_1 \times 1.21 \]  We know that:  \[ P_2 = 2P_0 \]  Substituting \( P_1 \):  \[ P_1 \times 1.21 = 2P_0 \]  Substituting \( P_1 = P_0 \times (1 + r) \):  \[ (P_0 \times (1 + r)) \times 1.21 = 2P_0 \]  Dividing both sides by \( P_0 \):  \[ (1 + r) \times 1.21 = 2 \]  Now, solving for \( r \):  \[ 1 + r = \frac{2}{1.21} \]  Calculating \( \frac{2}{1.21} \):  \[ \frac{2}{1.21} \approx 1.653 \]  Thus,  \[ r = 1.653 - 1 = 0.653 \]  To express \( r \) as a percentage:  \[ r \approx 0.653 \times 100 \approx 65.3\% \]  The closest option to this percentage increase is:  # 65%",,65.0

When one edge is trimmed by 4 feet, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece become \( s \) feet (the unchanged side) and \( s - 4 \) feet (the trimmed side).  The area \( A \) of the rectangle can be calculated as: \[ A = \text{length} \times \text{width} = s \times (s - 4) \]  This rectangle is then cut diagonally into two triangles. The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet. Therefore, the area of the rectangle can also be expressed as: \[ \text{Area of rectangle} = 2 \times \text{Area of one triangle} = 2 \times 70 = 140 \text{ square feet} \]  Setting the two expressions for the area equal gives: \[ s(s - 4) = 140 \]  Expanding this equation: \[ s^2 - 4s = 140 \]  Rearranging it into standard quadratic form: \[ s^2 - 4s - 140 = 0 \]  Next, we can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula: \[ s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \] where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -140 \).  Calculating the discriminant: \[ b^2 - 4ac = (-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-140) = 16 + 560 = 576 \]  Now, substituting back into the quadratic formula: \[ s = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{576}}{2} \] \[ s = \frac{4 \pm 24}{2} \]  Calculating the two possible values for \( s \): 1. \( s = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \) 2. \( s = \frac{-20}{2} = -10 \) (not a valid solution since side lengths cannot be negative)  Thus, the side length of the original square cloth is \( s = 14 \) feet.

The cow is tethered with a rope that is 14 feet long, which means the radius of the grazing area is 14 feet. The area \( A \) of a circle is given by the formula:  \[ A = \pi r^2 \]  where \( r \) is the radius. Substituting the radius:  \[ A = \pi (14)^2 = \pi \times 196 \approx 615.75 \text{ square feet} \]  Next, we know that the cow grazes 10 square feet per day.

Given: - Selling Price (SP) = Rs 27.50 - Profit Percentage = 10%  The formula for selling price when profit is involved is: \[ SP = CP + (Profit \% \times CP) \] This can be rewritten as: \[ SP = CP \times (1 + \frac{Profit \%}{100}) \]  Substituting the known values: \[ 27.50 = CP \times (1 + \frac{10}{100}) \] \[ 27.50 = CP \times 1.10 \]  Now, we can solve for CP: \[ CP = \frac{27.50}{1.10} \] \[ CP = 25.00 \]  Now that we have the cost price, we can find the profit or loss when the book is sold for Rs 25.75.  New Selling Price (SP) = Rs 25.75  Next, we calculate the profit or loss: \[ Profit/Loss = SP - CP \] \[ Profit/Loss = 25.75 - 25.00 \] \[ Profit/Loss = 0.75 \]  Since the selling price is greater than the cost price, we have a profit. Now, we calculate the percentage of profit: \[ \text{Percentage of Profit} = \left( \frac{Profit}{CP} \right) \times 100 \] \[ \text{Percentage of Profit} = \left( \frac{0.75}{25.00} \right) \times 100 \] \[ \text{Percentage of Profit} = 3\% \]  Thus, if the book were sold for Rs 25.75, there would be a profit of 3%.  The final answer is: # 3% Profit",,3.0
"In how many ways can a teacher in a kindergarten school arrange a group of 3 children (Susan, Tim and Zen) on 3 identical chairs in a straight line so that Susan is on the left of Tim? ['A)7', 'B)3', 'C)2', 'D)1', 'E)6']",3,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to arrange the three children (Susan, Tim, and Zen) on three identical chairs in a straight line, with the condition that Susan must be positioned to the left of Tim.  1. **Total Arrangements Without Restrictions**:     First, we calculate the total number of arrangements of the three children without any restrictions. Since there are 3 children, the total arrangements can be calculated using the factorial of the number of children:    \[    3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6    \]     The possible arrangements are:    - Susan, Tim, Zen (STZ)    - Susan, Zen, Tim (SZT)    - Tim, Susan, Zen (TSZ)    - Tim, Zen, Susan (TZS)    - Zen, Susan, Tim (ZST)    - Zen, Tim, Susan (ZTS)  2. **Applying the Condition (Susan Left of Tim)**:    Out of the 6 arrangements, we need to count only those where Susan is to the left of Tim.      The arrangements where Susan is to the left of Tim are:    - Susan, Tim, Zen (STZ)    - Susan, Zen, Tim (SZT)    - Zen, Susan, Tim (ZST)     The arrangements where Tim is to the left of Susan are:    - Tim, Susan, Zen (TSZ)    - Tim, Zen, Susan (TZS)    - Zen, Tim, Susan (ZTS)     Since the arrangements are symmetric, exactly half of the arrangements will have Susan to the left of Tim. Therefore, we can conclude:    \[    \text{Number of arrangements with Susan left of Tim} = \frac{6}{2} = 3    \]  Thus, the final answer is:  # 3",,3.0
"The telephone bill of a certain establishment is party fixed and partly varies as the number of calls consumed. When in a certain month 540 calls made the bill is Rs.1800. In another month 620 calls are consumed then the bill becomes Rs.2040. In another month 500 units are consumed due to more
holidays. The bill for that month would be : ['A)Rs.1560', 'B)Rs.1680', 'C)Rs.1840', 'D)Rs.1950', 'E)Rs.1690']",Rs.1680,"Let the fixed part of the telephone bill be \( F \) and the variable part per call be \( V \).   From the information given, we can set up the following equations based on the two months' bills:  1. For 540 calls:    \[    F + 540V = 1800 \quad \text{(1)}    \]  2. For 620 calls:    \[    F + 620V = 2040 \quad \text{(2)}    \]  Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously.   First, we can subtract equation (1) from equation (2): \[ (F + 620V) - (F + 540V) = 2040 - 1800 \] This simplifies to: \[ 80V = 240 \] From this, we can solve for \( V \): \[ V = \frac{240}{80} = 3 \]  Now that we have \( V \), we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find \( F \). Let's use equation (1): \[ F + 540 \times 3 = 1800 \] This simplifies to: \[ F + 1620 = 1800 \] Thus, \[ F = 1800 - 1620 = 180 \]  Now we have both \( F \) and \( V \): - Fixed part \( F = 180 \) - Variable part \( V = 3 \)  Next, we need to calculate the bill for the month when 500 calls are made: \[ \text{Bill} = F + 500V \] Substituting the values we found: \[ \text{Bill} = 180 + 500 \times 3 \] Calculating this gives: \[ \text{Bill} = 180 + 1500 = 1680 \]  Thus, the bill for that month would be:  # 1680",,1680.0

['A)10', 'B)15', 'C)18', 'D)20', 'E)30']",20,"To find the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.  Let: - \( H \) be the number of hardcover books = 30 - \( F \) be the number of fiction books = 20 - \( B \) be the total number of books = 45  We want to find the maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction, denoted as \( x \).  According to the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the total number of books can be expressed as:  \[ B = H + F - x \]  Substituting the known values into the equation:  \[ 45 = 30 + 20 - x \]  This simplifies to:  \[ 45 = 50 - x \]  Rearranging gives:  \[ x = 50 - 45 = 5 \]  This means that at least 5 books are both hardcover and fiction. However, we need to find the maximum possible value of \( x \).  To maximize \( x \), we need to consider the constraints: - The number of hardcover books cannot exceed 30. - The number of fiction books cannot exceed 20.  The maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction is limited by the smaller of the two groups. Since there are 20 fiction books, the maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction is 20.  Thus, the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is:  # 20",,20.0

['A)15', 'B)30', 'C)45', 'D)60', 'E)75']",15,"Let \( x \) be the number of newspapers the hotel buys on each of the days from Monday to Saturday. Since the hotel orders twice as many newspapers on Sunday, it buys \( 2x \) newspapers on that day.  The cost of newspapers for the week can be calculated as follows:  - From Monday to Saturday (6 days), the hotel buys \( x \) newspapers each day, so the total number of newspapers for these days is \( 6x \). - On Sunday, the hotel buys \( 2x \) newspapers.  The total number of newspapers bought in a week is: \[ 6x + 2x = 8x \]  Now, we calculate the total cost for the newspapers:  - The cost for the newspapers from Monday to Saturday (6 days) is \( 6 \times 1 \times x = 6x \) dollars. - The cost for the newspapers on Sunday is \( 4 \times 2x = 8x \) dollars.  Thus, the total cost for the week is: \[ 6x + 8x = 14x \]  According to the problem, the hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers: \[ 14x = 210 \]  To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 14: \[ x = \frac{210}{14} = 15 \]  Now, we need to find out how many newspapers the hotel buys on Monday.

"A number of friends decided to go on a picnic and planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. Four of them, however, did not turn up.

The number of those who attended the picnic was ['A)8', 'B)12', 'C)16', 'D)24', 'E)25']",8,"Let the total number of friends who initially planned to go on the picnic be \( x \). The total cost for the eatables is Rs. 96. Therefore, the contribution per person if all \( x \) friends had attended would be:  \[ \text{Contribution per person} = \frac{96}{x} \]  However, since 4 friends did not turn up, the number of friends who actually attended the picnic is \( x - 4 \). The contribution per person for those who attended is:  \[ \text{Contribution per person} = \frac{96}{x - 4} \]  According to the problem, the contribution per person for those who attended is Rs. 4 more than what it would have been if all had attended. Therefore, we can set up the equation:  \[ \frac{96}{x - 4} = \frac{96}{x} + 4 \]  To eliminate the fractions, we can multiply through by \( x(x - 4) \):  \[ 96x = 96(x - 4) + 4x(x - 4) \]  Expanding both sides:  \[ 96x = 96x - 384 + 4x^2 - 16x \]  Now, simplifying the equation:  \[ 0 = -384 + 4x^2 - 16x \]  Rearranging gives:  \[ 4x^2 - 16x + 384 = 0 \]  Dividing the entire equation by 4 simplifies it:  \[ x^2 - 4x + 96 = 0 \]  Next, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for \( x \):  \[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]  Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = 96 \):  \[ x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 96}}{2 \cdot 1} \] \[ x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 - 384}}{2} \] \[ x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{-368}}{2} \]  Since the discriminant is negative, it indicates that there is no real solution for \( x \) in this context.

Instead, we can try substituting the options given in the problem to find a valid solution.  1. **Option A: \( x = 8 \)**    - Contribution if all attended: \( \frac{96}{8} = 12 \)    - Contribution if 4 did not attend: \( \frac{96}{4} = 24 \)    - Difference: \( 24 - 12 = 12 \) (not valid)  2. **Option B: \( x = 12 \)**    - Contribution if all attended: \( \frac{96}{12} = 8 \)    - Contribution if 4 did not attend: \( \frac{96}{8} = 12 \)    - Difference: \( 12 - 8 = 4 \) (valid)  3. **Option C: \( x = 16 \)**    - Contribution if all attended: \( \frac{96}{16} = 6 \)    - Contribution if 4 did not attend: \( \frac{96}{12} = 8 \)    - Difference: \( 8 - 6 = 2 \) (not valid)  4. **Option D: \( x = 24 \)**    - Contribution if all attended: \( \frac{96}{24} = 4 \)    - Contribution if 4 did not attend: \( \frac{96}{20} = 4.8 \)    - Difference: \( 4.8 - 4 = 0.8 \) (not valid)  5. **Option E: \( x = 25 \)**    - Contribution if all attended: \( \frac{96}{25} = 3.84 \)    - Contribution if 4 did not attend: \( \frac{96}{21} = 4.57 \)    - Difference: \( 4.57 - 3.84 = 0.73 \) (not valid)  The only valid option is \( x = 12 \).

According to the problem: - Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives \( 4x \). - Each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so each son receives \( 5x \).  Now, we can express the total amount distributed among the sons, daughters, and nephews:  - There are 5 sons, so the total amount received by the sons is \( 5 \times 5x = 25x \). - There are 4 daughters, so the total amount received by the daughters is \( 4 \times 4x = 16x \). - There are 2 nephews, so the total amount received by the nephews is \( 2 \times x = 2x \).  Now, we can set up the equation for the total amount distributed:  \[ 25x + 16x + 2x = 8600 \]  Combining the terms gives:  \[ 43x = 8600 \]  Now, we can solve for \( x \):  \[ x = \frac{8600}{43} = 200 \]  Now that we have \( x \), we can find out how much each daughter receives:  Each daughter receives \( 4x \):  \[ 4x = 4 \times 200 = 800 \]  Thus, each daughter receives Rs 800.

Since the number of water lilies doubles every two days, we can think of the initial 64 water lilies as being equivalent to the state of the lake 6 days earlier (since 64 is \(2^6\), and starting from 1 water lily, it would take 6 doublings to reach 64).  Thus, if it takes 60 days to cover the lake starting from 1 water lily, starting from 64 water lilies means we subtract the 6 days it would take to reach 1 water lily:  \[ 60 - 6 = 54 \text{ days} \]  Therefore, the lake will be fully covered with water lilies in 54 days if we start with 64 water lilies.

We can form quadrilaterals by selecting 4 points from these 6. The number of ways to choose 4 points from 6 can be calculated using the combination formula:  \[ \binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \]  where \( n \) is the total number of points, and \( r \) is the number of points to choose.  In this case, \( n = 6 \) and \( r = 4 \):  \[ \binom{6}{4} = \frac{6!}{4!(6-4)!} = \frac{6!}{4! \cdot 2!} \]  Calculating the factorials:  \[ 6! = 720, \quad 4! = 24, \quad 2! = 2 \]  Now substituting these values into the combination formula:  \[ \binom{6}{4} = \frac{720}{24 \cdot 2} = \frac{720}{48} = 15 \]  Thus, the total number of different quadrilaterals that can be formed by joining 4 of the points A, B, C, D, E, and F is 15.

The total measure of a circle is 360°.     We can express minor arc AD in terms of the arcs we have:    - Minor arc AD = Minor arc AB + Minor arc BD + Minor arc DC.     We already know:    - Minor arc AB = 80° (from the bisection of arc AC).    - Minor arc BD = 150°.     Now, we need to find minor arc DC. Since points A, B, C, and D are in that order on the circle, we can find minor arc DC by subtracting the measures of arcs AB and AC from the total arc around point A to point C.     The total arc from A to C is 160°, and since B is between A and C, we have:    - Minor arc BC = 80° (as calculated).    - Therefore, minor arc AC = minor arc AB + minor arc BC = 80° + 80° = 160°.     Now, we can find minor arc AD:    - Minor arc AD = Minor arc AB + Minor arc BD = 80° + 150° = 230°.

"A starts a business with Rs.40,000. After 2 months, B joined him with Rs.60,000. C joined them after some more time with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. How many months after B joined the business, did C join? ['A)2 months', 'B)4 months', 'C)23 months', 'D)24 months', 'E)84 months']",4 months,"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many months after B joined the business that C joined, based on the profit-sharing arrangement.  1. **Initial Investments and Time Contributions**:    - A starts with Rs. 40,000 for 12 months.    - B joins after 2 months with Rs. 60,000, so B's investment is for 10 months (12 - 2 = 10).    - C joins after some time with Rs. 120,000. Let’s denote the number of months after B joined that C joined as \( x \). Therefore, C's investment is for \( 10 - x \) months.  2. **Calculating the Capital Contributions**:    - A's contribution in terms of capital months:       \[      40,000 \times 12 = 480,000      \]    - B's contribution in terms of capital months:      \[      60,000 \times 10 = 600,000      \]    - C's contribution in terms of capital months:      \[      120,000 \times (10 - x)      \]  3. **Total Capital Contribution**:    The total capital contribution can be expressed as:    \[    \text{Total} = 480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000 \times (10 - x)    \]  4. **Profit Sharing**:    The total profit is Rs. 375,000, and C's share is Rs. 150,000. The ratio of C's share to the total profit is:    \[    \frac{150,000}{375,000} = \frac{2}{5}    \]    This means C's capital contribution must also be in the ratio of \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total capital contribution.  5. **Setting Up the Equation**:    Let’s denote the total capital contribution as \( T \):    \[    T = 480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000 \times (10 - x)    \]    C's share of the total capital contribution is:    \[    120,000 \times (10 - x)    \]    Setting up the equation based on the profit-sharing ratio:    \[    \frac{120,000 \times (10 - x)}{T} = \frac{2}{5}    \]  6. **Substituting for T**:    Substitute \( T \) into the equation:    \[    \frac{120,000 \times (10 - x)}{480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000 \times (10 - x)} = \frac{2}{5}    \]    Simplifying the denominator:    \[    T = 1,080,000 + 120,000 \times (10 - x)    \]    Thus, we have:    \[    \frac{120,000 \times (10 - x)}{1,080,000 + 120,000 \times (10 - x)} = \frac{2}{5}    \]  7. **Cross-Multiplying**:    Cross-multiplying gives:    \[    5 \times 120,000 \times (10 - x) = 2 \times (1,080,000 + 120,000 \times (10 - x))    \]    Expanding both sides:    \[    600,000 \times (10 - x) = 2,160,000 + 240,000 \times (10 - x)    \]    Rearranging gives:    \[    600,000 \times (10 - x) - 240,000 \times (10 - x) = 2,160,000    \]    \[    360,000 \times (10 - x) = 2,160,000    \]    Dividing both sides by 360,000:    \[    10 - x = 6    \]    Thus:    \[    x = 4    \]  Therefore, C joined the business 4 months after B joined.

Therefore, the radius \( r \) is:    \[    r = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ cm}    \]    Now, substituting the radius into the area formula:    \[    A_{\text{semi-circle}} = \frac{1}{2} \pi (10)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (100) = 50\pi \text{ cm}^2    \]  3. **Calculate the area of two semi-circles**:    Since there are two semi-circles, the total area \( A_{\text{two semi-circles}} \) is:    \[    A_{\text{two semi-circles}} = 2 \times A_{\text{semi-circle}} = 2 \times 50\pi = 100\pi \text{ cm}^2    \]  4. **Calculate the area of the remaining paper**:    The area of the remaining paper \( A_{\text{remaining}} \) is the area of the square minus the area of the two semi-circles:    \[    A_{\text{remaining}} = A_{\text{square}} - A_{\text{two semi-circles}} = 400 - 100\pi    \]  5. **Substituting the value of \( \pi \)**:    Using \( \pi \approx 3.14 \):    \[    A_{\text{remaining}} = 400 - 100 \times 3.14 = 400 - 314 = 86 \text{ cm}^2    \]  6. **Final calculation**:    The area of the remaining paper is:    \[    A_{\text{remaining}} \approx 86 \text{ cm}^2    \]  However, the options provided seem to suggest a different interpretation. Let's check the calculations again for any possible misunderstanding.  The area of the remaining paper after cutting out the two semi-circles is indeed: \[ A_{\text{remaining}} = 400 - 100\pi \approx 400 - 314.16 \approx 85.84 \text{ cm}^2 \]  Since the options provided are in the range of 8.7, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem.   If we consider the area of the remaining paper in a different context, we can conclude that the area of the remaining paper is approximately:  # 85.84",,85.84

After the membership drive, the new number of boys and girls will be:  - New number of boys = \( 64 + x \) - New number of girls = \( 40 + x \)  According to the problem, the ratio of boys to girls after the membership drive is 4:3. This can be expressed as:  \[ \frac{64 + x}{40 + x} = \frac{4}{3} \]  To eliminate the fraction, we can cross-multiply:  \[ 3(64 + x) = 4(40 + x) \]  Expanding both sides gives:  \[ 192 + 3x = 160 + 4x \]  Now, we can rearrange the equation to isolate \( x \):  \[ 192 - 160 = 4x - 3x \]  This simplifies to:  \[ 32 = x \]  Now that we have found \( x \), we can calculate the new number of boys and girls:  - New number of boys = \( 64 + 32 = 96 \) - New number of girls = \( 40 + 32 = 72 \)  Now, we can find the total number of members in the group:  \[ \text{Total members} = \text{New number of boys} + \text{New number of girls} = 96 + 72 = 168 \]  Thus, the total number of members in the group now is:  # 168",,168.0

The time taken to return from B to A is:  \[ t_2 = \frac{d}{90} \]  According to the problem, 3 hours before the end of his trip, Kevin was still 70 miles away from B. This means he had already traveled \( d - 70 \) miles towards B. The time taken to travel this distance at 70 mph is:  \[ t_{approaching} = \frac{d - 70}{70} \]  At this point, he has 3 hours left until he reaches B. Therefore, the total time from the moment he was 70 miles away from B until he reaches B is:  \[ t_{remaining} = 3 \text{ hours} \]  The time taken to cover the remaining 70 miles at 70 mph is:  \[ t_{remaining} = \frac{70}{70} = 1 \text{ hour} \]  Thus, the total time from the moment he was 70 miles away from B until he reaches B is:  \[ t_{approaching} + t_{remaining} = \frac{d - 70}{70} + 1 \]  Setting this equal to the 3 hours he had left:  \[ \frac{d - 70}{70} + 1 = 3 \]  Now, we can solve for \( d \):  \[ \frac{d - 70}{70} = 3 - 1 \] \[ \frac{d - 70}{70} = 2 \] \[ d - 70 = 2 \times 70 \] \[ d - 70 = 140 \] \[ d = 140 + 70 \] \[ d = 210 \]  Now, we check if this distance fits any of the provided options.

The sum of the numbers:    \[    x + y = 1000    \]  Now, we can substitute \( x + y \) into the first equation. Let \( s = x + y = 1000 \) and \( d = x - y \). Then we can rewrite the first equation as: \[ d \cdot s = 256000 \] Substituting \( s \): \[ d \cdot 1000 = 256000 \] Solving for \( d \): \[ d = \frac{256000}{1000} = 256 \]  Now we have: - \( x + y = 1000 \) - \( x - y = 256 \)  We can solve these two equations simultaneously. Adding the two equations: \[ (x + y) + (x - y) = 1000 + 256 \] \[ 2x = 1256 \] \[ x = \frac{1256}{2} = 628 \]  Now substituting \( x \) back into the equation for \( y \): \[ 628 + y = 1000 \] \[ y = 1000 - 628 = 372 \]  Thus, the two numbers are \( 628 \) and \( 372 \).

"Everyone in the family earns money each month. If the total income of a family per month is $9000 and the median income is $3000, how many members are there in the family? ['A)2', 'B)3', 'C)4', 'D)5', 'E)6']",3,"To determine the number of members in the family based on the total income and the median income, we need to understand the implications of the median in relation to the total income.  1. **Understanding Median**: The median income is the middle value when all incomes are arranged in ascending order. If there is an odd number of family members, the median is the middle income. If there is an even number of family members, the median is the average of the two middle incomes.  2. **Given Information**:    - Total income = $9000    - Median income = $3000  3. **Analyzing Possible Family Sizes**:    - **If there are 2 members**: The median would be the average of the two incomes. For the median to be $3000, both incomes would need to be $3000. This gives a total income of $6000, which does not match the given total of $9000. So, 2 members is not possible.        - **If there are 3 members**: The median would be the second income when arranged in order. For the median to be $3000, the incomes could be something like $x, $3000, and $y, where $x ≤ 3000 ≤ $y. The total income would be $x + 3000 + y = 9000, which simplifies to $x + y = 6000. This is possible, so 3 members is a valid option.        - **If there are 4 members**: The median would be the average of the two middle incomes. For the median to be $3000, the two middle incomes would need to average to $3000. This means they could be $3000 and $3000, or $x$ and $y$ where $x + y = 6000. However, this would require the total income to be $3000 + $3000 + $x + $y = 9000$, which is possible. So, 4 members is also a valid option.        - **If there are 5 members**: The median would be the third income when arranged in order. For the median to be $3000, the incomes could be $x, $y, $3000, $z, and $w, where $x ≤ y ≤ 3000 ≤ z ≤ w. The total income would be $x + y + 3000 + z + w = 9000, which simplifies to $x + y + z + w = 6000. This is also possible, so 5 members is a valid option.        - **If there are 6 members**: The median would be the average of the third and fourth incomes. For the median to be $3000, the two middle incomes would need to average to $3000. This means they could be $3000 and $3000, or $x$ and $y$ where $x + y = 6000. However, this would require the total income to be $3000 + $3000 + $x + $y + $z + $w = 9000$, which is possible. So, 6 members is also a valid option.  4. **Conclusion**: The possible family sizes that satisfy both the total income of $9000 and the median income of $3000 are 3, 4, 5, and 6 members. However, since the question asks for the number of members, we need to find the minimum number of members that can satisfy the conditions.  The minimum number of members that can satisfy the conditions is 3.  Thus, the final answer is:  # 3",,3.0

The earnings from the copper coins and brass coins can be expressed as follows:  - Each copper coin earns 20 cents, so the total earnings from copper coins is \( 20c \) cents. - Each brass coin earns 25 cents, so the total earnings from brass coins is \( 25b \) cents.  The total earnings from both types of coins is given as $3.40, which is equivalent to 340 cents. Therefore, we can set up the equation:  \[ 20c + 25b = 340 \]  To simplify this equation, we can divide all terms by 5:  \[ 4c + 5b = 68 \]  Next, we want to express \( b \) in terms of \( c \):  \[ 5b = 68 - 4c \] \[ b = \frac{68 - 4c}{5} \]  For \( b \) to be a non-negative integer, \( 68 - 4c \) must be non-negative and divisible by 5.

Let \( h \) be the height of the building. According to the problem, we have:  \[ \frac{\text{Height of flagstaff}}{\text{Length of flagstaff's shadow}} = \frac{\text{Height of building}}{\text{Length of building's shadow}} \]  Substituting the known values:  \[ \frac{17.5}{40.25} = \frac{h}{28.75} \]  Now, we can cross-multiply to solve for \( h \):  \[ 17.5 \times 28.75 = h \times 40.25 \]  Calculating \( 17.5 \times 28.75 \):  \[ 17.5 \times 28.75 = 503.125 \]  Now, we have:  \[ 503.125 = h \times 40.25 \]  To isolate \( h \), divide both sides by 40.25:  \[ h = \frac{503.125}{40.25} \]  Calculating \( \frac{503.125}{40.25} \):  \[ h \approx 12.5 \]  Thus, the height of the building is approximately 12.5 meters.

Given: - \( P(A) = 0.6 \) - \( P(A \cup B) = 0.96 \)  For independent events, the probability of the union of two events can be expressed as: \[ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) \] Since A and B are independent, we have: \[ P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B) \] Substituting this into the union formula gives: \[ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A) \cdot P(B) \] Now, substituting the known values: \[ 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6 \cdot P(B) \] Let \( P(B) = p \).

['A)2', 'B)3', 'C)4', 'D)5', 'E)6']",6,"To determine how many ties you need to take out from your rack to ensure that you have at least two ties of the same color, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle.   The Pigeonhole Principle states that if you have more items than containers, at least one container must contain more than one item. In this case, the ""containers"" are the colors of the ties, and the ""items"" are the ties themselves.  You have the following colors of ties: - Red: 8 ties - Violet: 13 ties - Blue: 10 ties - Pink: 5 ties - Green: 4 ties  This gives us a total of 5 different colors of ties.  To ensure that you have at least two ties of the same color, you can consider the worst-case scenario where you pick one tie of each color first. In this case, you would take out: - 1 Red - 1 Violet - 1 Blue - 1 Pink - 1 Green  This totals to 5 ties, and at this point, you have one tie of each color. If you take out one more tie (the 6th tie), it must be of one of the colors you already have, thus ensuring that you have at least two ties of the same color.

Next, we need to find the time at which the two trains cross each other.  - Train M starts at 5 am and travels towards City B. - Train N starts at 7 am and travels towards City A.  Let \( t \) be the time in hours after 5 am when the two trains cross each other.  - By the time Train N starts at 7 am, Train M has already been traveling for 2 hours. - Distance covered by Train M in 2 hours = \( 2 \times \frac{D}{4} = \frac{D}{2} \). - Remaining distance for Train M to reach City B = \( D - \frac{D}{2} = \frac{D}{2} \).  Now, when Train N starts at 7 am, Train M has \( \frac{D}{2} \) distance left to cover, and Train N is at City B.  From 7 am onwards, both trains are moving towards each other. The combined speed of both trains is: - Speed of Train M = \( \frac{D}{4} \) - Speed of Train N = \( \frac{2D}{7} \)  The combined speed = \( \frac{D}{4} + \frac{2D}{7} \).  To add these speeds, we need a common denominator: - The least common multiple of 4 and 7 is 28.  Converting the speeds: - Speed of Train M = \( \frac{D}{4} = \frac{7D}{28} \) - Speed of Train N = \( \frac{2D}{7} = \frac{8D}{28} \)  Combined speed = \( \frac{7D}{28} + \frac{8D}{28} = \frac{15D}{28} \).  Now, we can find the time \( t \) it takes for the two trains to meet after 7 am. The distance between them at 7 am is \( \frac{D}{2} \).  Using the formula: \[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{\frac{D}{2}}{\frac{15D}{28}} = \frac{D}{2} \times \frac{28}{15D} = \frac{28}{30} = \frac{14}{15} \text{ hours}. \]  Now, converting \( \frac{14}{15} \) hours into minutes: \[ \frac{14}{15} \text{ hours} = \frac{14}{15} \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 56 \text{ minutes}. \]  Since Train N starts at 7 am, the time they cross each other is: \[ 7:00 \text{ am} + 56 \text{ minutes} = 7:56 \text{ am}. \]  Thus, the two trains cross each other at 7:56 am.

Since each of the 10 songs was selected 5 times, the total number of selections can also be calculated as: \[ 10 \text{ songs} \times 5 \text{ selections per song} = 50 \text{ total selections} \]  Now, we can set up the equation: \[ 2S = 50 \]  To find \( S \), we divide both sides by 2: \[ S = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]  Thus, the total number of students surveyed is 25.

According to Vieta's, the sum of the roots \( r_1 + r_2 \) of the quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \) and the product of the roots \( r_1 \cdot r_2 \) is given by \( \frac{c}{a} \).  In our case, the equation is:  \[ x^2 + mx + 22 = 0 \]  Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = m \), and \( c = 22 \).  Let \( r_1 = 1.5 \) and \( r_2 \) be the other root.   1. **Calculate the product of the roots:**    \[    r_1 \cdot r_2 = \frac{c}{a} = \frac{22}{1} = 22    \]    Therefore,    \[    1.5 \cdot r_2 = 22    \]    Solving for \( r_2 \):    \[    r_2 = \frac{22}{1.5} = \frac{22 \cdot 2}{3} = \frac{44}{3} \approx 14.67    \]  2. **Calculate the sum of the roots:**    \[    r_1 + r_2 = -\frac{b}{a} = -m    \]    Thus,    \[    1.5 + r_2 = -m    \]    Substituting \( r_2 \):    \[    1.5 + \frac{44}{3} = -m    \]    To add these, convert \( 1.5 \) to a fraction:    \[    1.5 = \frac{3}{2} = \frac{9}{6}    \]    Now convert \( \frac{44}{3} \) to have a common denominator of 6:    \[    \frac{44}{3} = \frac{88}{6}    \]    Now we can add:    \[    \frac{9}{6} + \frac{88}{6} = \frac{97}{6}    \]    Therefore,    \[    -m = \frac{97}{6}    \]    Thus,    \[    m = -\frac{97}{6}    \]  3. **Convert \( m \) to a decimal:**    \[    -\frac{97}{6} \approx -16.1667    \]  Now, we can compare this value with the options provided.

Let’s denote: - \( S \) as the amount of money Sharon earns in 5 hours. - \( K \) as the amount of money Karen earns in 4 hours.  From the information given, we can find their hourly rates: - Sharon's hourly rate is \( \frac{S}{5} \). - Karen's hourly rate is \( \frac{K}{4} \).  Next, we need to find a common amount that they can earn together. Since they are working together, we can add their rates to find their combined rate.  Let’s denote the total amount needed to buy the ice cream cake as \( C \). We know that: - Sharon earns \( S = C \) after 5 hours. - Karen earns \( K = C \) after 4 hours.  To find the total amount they can earn together, we need to express \( S \) and \( K \) in terms of \( C \): - Sharon's hourly rate: \( \frac{C}{5} \) - Karen's hourly rate: \( \frac{C}{4} \)  Now, we can find their combined hourly rate: \[ \text{Combined rate} = \frac{C}{5} + \frac{C}{4} \]  To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 5 and 4 is 20. Thus, we convert the rates: \[ \frac{C}{5} = \frac{4C}{20} \] \[ \frac{C}{4} = \frac{5C}{20} \]  Now we can add them: \[ \text{Combined rate} = \frac{4C}{20} + \frac{5C}{20} = \frac{9C}{20} \]  This means together they earn \( \frac{9C}{20} \) per hour. To find out how many hours \( t \) it will take for them to earn \( C \), we set up the equation: \[ \frac{9C}{20} \cdot t = C \]  Dividing both sides by \( C \) (assuming \( C \neq 0 \)): \[ \frac{9t}{20} = 1 \]  Now, we solve for \( t \): \[ 9t = 20 \] \[ t = \frac{20}{9} \approx 2.22 \text{ hours} \]  Since we need to find the closest whole number of hours they can work together to buy the cake, we can round \( \frac{20}{9} \) to the nearest whole number, which is 2 hours.

Since \( x < 0 \), we have \( |x^3| = -x^3 \) (because \( x^3 \) is also negative). 2. Since \( y > 0 \), we have \( |y^2| = y^2 \).  Thus, the inequality \( |x^3| > |y^2| \) becomes:  \[ -x^3 > y^2 \]  This can be rearranged to:  \[ -x^3 - y^2 > 0 \quad \text{or} \quad -x^3 > y^2 \]  Now, let's analyze each option:  **A) \( x > y \)**  Since \( x < 0 \) and \( y > 0 \), this cannot be true. Therefore, option A is false.  **B) \( y^2 > x^2 \)**  Since \( x < 0 \), we have \( x^2 > 0 \). The inequality \( |x^3| > |y^2| \) implies \( -x^3 > y^2 \). Since \( -x^3 > 0 \) (as \( x^3 < 0 \)), we cannot directly conclude that \( y^2 > x^2 \). Therefore, option B is not necessarily true.  **C) \( -x^3 < y^2 \)**  This is the same as the rearranged inequality we derived earlier, which states \( -x^3 > y^2 \). Therefore, option C is false.  **D) \( -x < y \)**  Since \( x < 0 \), we can write \( -x > 0 \). The inequality \( -x^3 > y^2 \) implies that \( -x^3 \) is a positive number greater than \( y^2 \). However, we cannot directly conclude that \( -x < y \) from this information. Therefore, option D is not necessarily true.  **E) \( x < -y \)**  Since \( x < 0 \) and \( y > 0 \), we can analyze this inequality. Rearranging gives \( x + y < 0 \). However, we cannot conclude this from the given information. Therefore, option E is not necessarily true.  After analyzing all options, we find that none of the options must be true based on the given conditions.

Let \( C \) be the cover price per issue. The total cover price for 15 issues would then be:  \[ 15C \]  According to the problem, the subscription cost of $42.00 represents a saving of 25% off the cover price. This means that the subscription price is 75% of the total cover price. We can express this relationship mathematically as:  \[ 42 = 0.75 \times (15C) \]  To isolate \( 15C \), we can divide both sides by 0.75:  \[ 15C = \frac{42}{0.75} \]  Calculating the right side:  \[ \frac{42}{0.75} = 42 \div 0.75 = 42 \times \frac{100}{75} = 42 \times \frac{4}{3} = 56 \]  So, we have:  \[ 15C = 56 \]  Next, we solve for \( C \) by dividing both sides by 15:  \[ C = \frac{56}{15} \]  Calculating this gives:  \[ C = 3.7333\ldots \]  Rounding to two decimal places, we find:  \[ C \approx 3.73 \]  Thus, the cover price per issue is approximately $3.73.

The multiplication table suggests that we are dealing with a multiplication operation where the letters represent digits.  Let's denote: - M = m - A = a - D = d - B = b - E = e - R = r  From the multiplication table, we can see the following structure:  ```       M A D     B E -------------     M A D     R A E ------------- A M I D ```  This indicates that: 1. The product of (B E) and (M A D) gives us (M A D) and (R A E). 2. The result of the multiplication is (A M I D).  To solve this, we can interpret the letters as digits in a base-10 system.   Let's analyze the multiplication step by step:  1. **Identify the structure**:     - The first row (M A D) represents a three-digit number.    - The second row (B E) represents a two-digit number.    - The result (R A E) is also a three-digit number.  2. **Set up the multiplication**:    - The multiplication can be expressed as:      \[      (B \times 100 + E \times 10) \times (M \times 100 + A \times 10 + D) = (M \times 100 + A \times 10 + D) + (R \times 100 + A \times 10 + E)      \]  3. **Analyze the options**:    - The options provided are:      - A) 9 2 0 0      - B) 9 2 0 9      - C) 9 2 0 1      - D) 9 2 0 7      - E) 9 2 2 2  4. **Testing the options**:    - We need to find a combination of values for M, A, D, B, E, and R that satisfies the multiplication and results in a valid three-digit number.  After testing the combinations, we find that:  - If we assign:   - M = 9   - A = 2   - D = 0   - B = 9   - E = 2   - R = 0  Then we can calculate: \[ (92) \times (90) = 8280 \] This does not match any of the options.

We know that \(a^2 - b^2\) can be factored using the difference of squares:  \[ a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \]  Substituting this into our expression gives:  \[ \frac{(a - b)(a + b)}{(a + b)^2} \]  Now, we can simplify this fraction:  \[ \frac{(a - b)(a + b)}{(a + b)(a + b)} = \frac{a - b}{a + b} \]  Now we have:  \[ \frac{a - b}{a + b} \quad ? = (a - b)^2 \]  Next, we need to determine what should replace the question mark (?) to make the equation true. We can multiply both sides by \(a + b\) to eliminate the fraction:  \[ a - b = (a - b)^2 (a + b) \]  Now, we can analyze the right-hand side:  \[ (a - b)^2 (a + b) = (a - b)(a - b)(a + b) \]  This means we need to find a value for ? such that:  \[ \frac{a - b}{a + b} = (a - b)(a + b) \]  To find the correct option, we can check the provided choices:  1. **A)** \((a + b)(a - b)\) 2. **B)** \((a - b)^2\) 3. **C)** \((a + b)^2\) 4. **D)** \(a^3 + b^3\) 5. **E)** None of these  Since we have established that:  \[ \frac{a - b}{a + b} = (a - b)(a + b) \]  This means that the left-hand side simplifies to \((a - b)(a + b)\), which corresponds to option A.

"A number is as much greater than 36 as is less than 86. Find the Number. ['A)60', 'B)56', 'C)51', 'D)61', 'E)41']",61,"Let the unknown number be \( x \).  According to the problem, the number \( x \) is as much greater than 36 as it is less than 86. This can be expressed mathematically as:  \[ x - 36 = 86 - x \]  Now, we will solve for \( x \).  1. Start by adding \( x \) to both sides of the equation:  \[ x - 36 + x = 86 - x + x \]  This simplifies to:  \[ 2x - 36 = 86 \]  2. Next, add 36 to both sides:  \[ 2x = 86 + 36 \]  This simplifies to:  \[ 2x = 122 \]  3. Now, divide both sides by 2:  \[ x = \frac{122}{2} \]  This simplifies to:  \[ x = 61 \]  Thus, the number is 61.  Finally, we present the answer:  # 61",,61.0

Each crate consists of \( p \) pallets. 2. Each pallet holds 1250 phones.  Now, we can calculate the total number of phones in one crate:  \[ \text{Number of phones in one crate} = \text{Number of pallets in one crate} \times \text{Number of phones per pallet} = p \times 1250 \]  Next, since the manufacturer ships 4 crates, we can find the total number of phones shipped by multiplying the number of phones in one crate by the number of crates:  \[ \text{Total number of phones shipped} = \text{Number of phones in one crate} \times \text{Number of crates} = (p \times 1250) \times 4 \]  Now, simplifying this expression:  \[ \text{Total number of phones shipped} = 4p \times 1250 = 5000p \]  Now, we need to compare this result with the provided options.

"A can construct a wall in 40 min and B can construct the wall in 45 min. How many hours is needed to contruct a wall if both the person working together. ['A)20 min', 'B)22 min', 'C)23 min', 'D)21 min', 'E)20 min']",21 min,"To find out how long it takes for A and B to construct the wall together, we first need to determine their individual work rates.  1. **Calculate A's work rate:**    A can complete the wall in 40 minutes. Therefore, A's work rate is:    \[    \text{Rate of A} = \frac{1 \text{ wall}}{40 \text{ min}} = \frac{1}{40} \text{ walls per minute}    \]  2. **Calculate B's work rate:**    B can complete the wall in 45 minutes. Therefore, B's work rate is:    \[    \text{Rate of B} = \frac{1 \text{ wall}}{45 \text{ min}} = \frac{1}{45} \text{ walls per minute}    \]  3. **Combine their work rates:**    When A and B work together, their combined work rate is the sum of their individual rates:    \[    \text{Combined Rate} = \text{Rate of A} + \text{Rate of B} = \frac{1}{40} + \frac{1}{45}    \]     To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 40 and 45 is 360.     Converting each rate:    \[    \frac{1}{40} = \frac{9}{360}    \]    \[    \frac{1}{45} = \frac{8}{360}    \]     Now, adding the two rates:    \[    \text{Combined Rate} = \frac{9}{360} + \frac{8}{360} = \frac{17}{360} \text{ walls per minute}    \]  4. **Calculate the time to complete one wall together:**    To find the time \( t \) it takes to complete one wall, we take the reciprocal of the combined rate:    \[    t = \frac{1 \text{ wall}}{\frac{17}{360} \text{ walls per minute}} = \frac{360}{17} \text{ minutes}    \]     Now, we can calculate \( \frac{360}{17} \):    \[    \frac{360}{17} \approx 21.176 \text{ minutes}    \]  5. **Convert to minutes and round appropriately:**    Since the options are in whole minutes, we can round \( 21.176 \) to the nearest whole number, which is 21 minutes.  Thus, the time needed to construct the wall if both A and B work together is approximately 21 minutes.  The final answer is: # 21 min",,21.0
"An express electric train takes exact three seconds to enter tunnel which is 1 mile long.
If train is traveling at 120 mile an hour, how long will it take to pass completely through the tunnel ? ['A)43 seconds', 'B)39 seconds', 'C)20 seconds', 'D)33 seconds', 'E)55 seconds']",33 seconds,"To determine how long it will take for the train to completely pass through the tunnel, we need to consider both the length of the train and the length of the tunnel.  1. **Convert the speed of the train to a more manageable unit**:    The train is traveling at 120 miles per hour. We can convert this speed to miles per second:    \[    120 \text{ miles/hour} = \frac{120 \text{ miles}}{3600 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{1}{30} \text{ miles/second}    \]  2. **Determine the length of the train**:    The train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel. During this time, it travels a distance equal to its own length. The distance traveled in 3 seconds at a speed of \(\frac{1}{30}\) miles/second is:    \[    \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = \frac{1}{30} \text{ miles/second} \times 3 \text{ seconds} = \frac{3}{30} \text{ miles} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles}    \]    Therefore, the length of the train is \(\frac{1}{10}\) miles.  3. **Calculate the total distance to be covered**:    To completely pass through the tunnel, the train must travel the length of the tunnel plus its own length:    \[    \text{Total distance} = \text{Length of tunnel} + \text{Length of train} = 1 \text{ mile} + \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles} = 1.1 \text{ miles}    \]  4. **Calculate the time to travel the total distance**:    Now we can find the time it takes to travel 1.1 miles at a speed of \(\frac{1}{30}\) miles/second:    \[    \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{1.1 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{30} \text{ miles/second}} = 1.1 \times 30 \text{ seconds} = 33 \text{ seconds}    \]  Thus, the total time for the train to completely pass through the tunnel is 33 seconds.  # 33",,33.0

In our case, \( n = 10 \) and \( r = 5 \):     \[    \binom{10}{5} = \frac{10!}{5! \cdot 5!} = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 252    \]  2. **Accounting for indistinguishable groups**: Since the two groups are indistinguishable (i.e., Group 1 and Group 2 are not labeled), we have counted each arrangement twice (once for each labeling). Therefore, we need to divide the result by 2:     \[    \text{Number of ways to create the groups} = \frac{252}{2} = 126    \]  Thus, the total number of ways to create the two groups of 5 members each from 10 members is 126.  # 126",,126.0

This means that for every 2 parts of rice, there are 3 parts of wheat and 5 parts of corn.  Let's denote the parts of rice, wheat, and corn as follows: - Rice = 2 parts - Wheat = 3 parts - Corn = 5 parts  The total number of parts in the mixture is: \[  2 + 3 + 5 = 10 \text{ parts}  \]  Next, we know that the amount of rice in the mixture is 3 pounds. Since rice corresponds to 2 parts of the total 10 parts, we can set up a proportion to find the weight of one part:  Let \( x \) be the weight of one part. Then: \[  2x = 3 \text{ pounds}  \]  To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 2: \[  x = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ pounds per part}  \]  Now, we can find the amount of corn, which corresponds to 5 parts: \[  \text{Corn} = 5x = 5 \times 1.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}  \]  Thus, the amount of corn in the mixture is 7.5 pounds.

From the second scenario (two sodas and three energy bars for 300 cents):    \[    2s + 3e = 300    \]  Now we have a system of linear equations:  \[ \begin{align*} (1) & \quad s + 2e = 150 \\ (2) & \quad 2s + 3e = 300 \end{align*} \]  We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use the substitution method. From equation (1), we can express \( s \) in terms of \( e \):  \[ s = 150 - 2e \]  Now, substitute \( s \) into equation (2):  \[ 2(150 - 2e) + 3e = 300 \]  Expanding this gives:  \[ 300 - 4e + 3e = 300 \]  Simplifying this, we have:  \[ 300 - e = 300 \]  Subtracting 300 from both sides:  \[ -e = 0 \]  Thus, we find:  \[ e = 0 \]  Now substituting \( e = 0 \) back into equation (1) to find \( s \):  \[ s + 2(0) = 150 \implies s = 150 \]  Now we have the costs: - Cost of one soda \( s = 150 \) cents - Cost of one energy bar \( e = 0 \) cents  Next, we need to compute the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars:  \[ \text{Total cost} = 6s + 7e = 6(150) + 7(0) = 900 + 0 = 900 \text{ cents} \]  Thus, the final answer is:  # 900",,900.0

['A)After 6 minutes', 'B)After 12 minutes', 'C)After 18 minutes', 'D)After 24 minutes', 'E)none']",After 12 minutes,"To determine when the three bells will ring together again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their ringing intervals: 36 seconds, 40 seconds, and 48 seconds.  1. **Prime Factorization**:    - For 36:       \[      36 = 2^2 \times 3^2      \]    - For 40:       \[      40 = 2^3 \times 5^1      \]    - For 48:       \[      48 = 2^4 \times 3^1      \]  2. **Finding the LCM**:    The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in the factorizations:    - For \(2\): the highest power is \(2^4\) (from 48).    - For \(3\): the highest power is \(3^2\) (from 36).    - For \(5\): the highest power is \(5^1\) (from 40).     Therefore, the LCM is:    \[    LCM = 2^4 \times 3^2 \times 5^1    \]  3. **Calculating the LCM**:    - Calculate \(2^4 = 16\)    - Calculate \(3^2 = 9\)    - Calculate \(5^1 = 5\)     Now, multiply these together:    \[    LCM = 16 \times 9 \times 5    \]     First, calculate \(16 \times 9\):    \[    16 \times 9 = 144    \]     Now, multiply \(144 \times 5\):    \[    144 \times 5 = 720    \]  Thus, the LCM of 36, 40, and 48 seconds is 720 seconds.  4. **Convert seconds to minutes**:    To convert seconds to minutes, divide by 60:    \[    720 \text{ seconds} = \frac{720}{60} = 12 \text{ minutes}    \]  Therefore, the three bells will ring together again after 12 minutes.  # 12 minutes",,12.0
"An electric pole, 14 metres high, casts a shadow of 10 metres. Find the height of a tree that casts a shadow of 15 metres under similar conditions. ['A)21', 'B)22', 'C)20', 'D)23', 'E)24']",21,"To solve the problem, we can use the concept of similar triangles. The height of the electric pole and its shadow form one triangle, while the height of the tree and its shadow form another triangle. Since the conditions are similar, the ratios of the heights to the lengths of the shadows will be equal.  Let: - \( h_p = 14 \) meters (height of the electric pole) - \( s_p = 10 \) meters (shadow of the electric pole) - \( h_t \) = height of the tree (unknown) - \( s_t = 15 \) meters (shadow of the tree)  According to the property of similar triangles, we have:  \[ \frac{h_p}{s_p} = \frac{h_t}{s_t} \]  Substituting the known values into the equation:  \[ \frac{14}{10} = \frac{h_t}{15} \]  Now, we can cross-multiply to solve for \( h_t \):  \[ 14 \cdot 15 = 10 \cdot h_t \]  Calculating the left side:  \[ 210 = 10 \cdot h_t \]  Now, divide both sides by 10 to isolate \( h_t \):  \[ h_t = \frac{210}{10} = 21 \]  Thus, the height of the tree is 21 meters.

['A)22 dollars', 'B)15 dollars', 'C)20 dollars', 'D)18 dollars', 'E)10 dollars']",15 dollars,"To determine the cost of a mango based on the prices of the other fruits, we first need to analyze the given prices:  - Orange: 18 dollars - Pineapple: 27 dollars - Grape: 15 dollars  Next, let's look for a pattern or a rule that could apply to these prices. One possible approach is to examine the number of vowels in the names of the fruits and see if there's a correlation with their prices.  1. **Orange**: 3 vowels (o, a, e) - Price: 18 dollars 2. **Pineapple**: 4 vowels (i, e, a, e) - Price: 27 dollars 3. **Grape**: 2 vowels (a, e) - Price: 15 dollars  Now, let's calculate the price per vowel for each fruit:  - Orange: 18 dollars / 3 vowels = 6 dollars per vowel - Pineapple: 27 dollars / 4 vowels = 6.75 dollars per vowel - Grape: 15 dollars / 2 vowels = 7.5 dollars per vowel  The prices per vowel do not seem to follow a consistent pattern. Let's try another approach by looking at the total number of letters in each fruit's name:  1. **Orange**: 6 letters - Price: 18 dollars 2. **Pineapple**: 9 letters - Price: 27 dollars 3. **Grape**: 5 letters - Price: 15 dollars  Now, let's calculate the price per letter for each fruit:  - Orange: 18 dollars / 6 letters = 3 dollars per letter - Pineapple: 27 dollars / 9 letters = 3 dollars per letter - Grape: 15 dollars / 5 letters = 3 dollars per letter  This shows that each fruit costs 3 dollars per letter.  Now, let's apply this to the mango:  - **Mango**: 5 letters  Calculating the cost:  Cost of mango = 5 letters * 3 dollars per letter = 15 dollars.  Thus, the cost of a mango is 15 dollars.  # 15",,15.0
"In the coordinate plane, a triangle has vertices at (a,0), (b,0), and (x,y). If a>x>b>0>y, which of the following represents the area of that triangle?

Therefore, we can rewrite the area as:  \[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot |y| \cdot (a - b) \]  Since \(y\) is negative, we can express \(|y|\) as \(-y\):  \[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} (-y)(a - b) = \frac{(a - b)(-y)}{2} \]  This matches the form of the options provided. The area can be expressed as:  \[ \text{Area} = \frac{(a - b)(-y)}{2} \]  Now, we can compare this with the options given.

Using the same distance formula:    \[    \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \, \text{km}}{10 \, \text{hours}} = 120 \, \text{km/hr}    \]  3. **Calculate the speed gain**:    The initial speed was 60 km/hr, and the new required speed is 120 km/hr. The gain in speed is:    \[    \text{Speed Gain} = \text{New Speed} - \text{Old Speed} = 120 \, \text{km/hr} - 60 \, \text{km/hr} = 60 \, \text{km/hr}    \]  Now, let's check the options provided: - A) 80 kmph - B) 50 kmph - C) 120 kmph - D) 70 kmph - E) 80 kmph  None of the options match the calculated speed gain of 60 km/hr.

"Three friends Alan, Roger and Peter attempt to answer a question on an exam. Alan randomly guesses the answer, giving him a 1/5 probability of guessing correctly.

And Peter dutifully performs the calculations, then marks the answer, giving him a 5/6 probability of a correct answer. What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating? ['A)1/18', 'B)1/9', 'C)23/90', 'D)5/18', 'E)13/45']",1/18,"To find the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating, we need to consider the probabilities of Alan and Peter answering correctly, since Roger's method involves cheating.  1. **Probability of Alan answering correctly**:     - Alan guesses randomly, so the probability \( P(A) \) of him answering correctly is \( \frac{1}{5} \).  2. **Probability of Peter answering correctly**:     - Peter performs calculations and has a probability \( P(P) \) of answering correctly of \( \frac{5}{6} \).  3. **Probability of Alan answering incorrectly**:     - The probability \( P(A') \) of Alan answering incorrectly is \( 1 - P(A) = 1 - \frac{1}{5} = \frac{4}{5} \).  4. **Probability of Peter answering incorrectly**:     - The probability \( P(P') \) of Peter answering incorrectly is \( 1 - P(P) = 1 - \frac{5}{6} = \frac{1}{6} \).  Now, we need to find the probability that either Alan or Peter answers correctly while ensuring that Roger does not contribute to the correct answer (since he cheats).  The event that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating can occur in two scenarios: - Alan answers correctly and Peter answers incorrectly. - Peter answers correctly and Alan answers incorrectly.  We can calculate the probabilities for these scenarios:  **Scenario 1**: Alan answers correctly and Peter answers incorrectly. - The probability of this happening is: \[ P(A \text{ and } P') = P(A) \cdot P(P') = \frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{30} \]  **Scenario 2**: Peter answers correctly and Alan answers incorrectly. - The probability of this happening is: \[ P(P \text{ and } A') = P(P) \cdot P(A') = \frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \]  Now, we need to combine these two probabilities to find the total probability of the question being answered correctly but not via cheating: \[ P(\text{correct but not cheating}) = P(A \text{ and } P') + P(P \text{ and } A') = \frac{1}{30} + \frac{2}{3} \]  To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 30 and 3 is 30: \[ \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2 \cdot 10}{3 \cdot 10} = \frac{20}{30} \]  Now we can add: \[ P(\text{correct but not cheating}) = \frac{1}{30} + \frac{20}{30} = \frac{21}{30} = \frac{7}{10} \]  However, we need to check if this matches any of the provided options. Since \( \frac{7}{10} \) does not match any of the options, let's re-evaluate the calculations.  The correct approach is to find the probability of the question being answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, and then subtract the probability of Roger answering correctly.  The total probability of answering correctly (including cheating) is: \[ P(\text{correct}) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A)P(P) + P(R) = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{5}{6} - \left(\frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{5}{6}\right) + \frac{2}{3} \]  However, since we are only interested in the non-cheating part, we can conclude that the probability of answering correctly without cheating is: \[ P(\text{correct but not cheating}) = \frac{1}{30} + \frac{20}{30} = \frac{21}{30} = \frac{7}{10} \]  This does not match the options provided, so let's check the calculations again.  The correct answer is: \[ P(\text{correct but not cheating}) = \frac{1}{30} + \frac{20}{30} = \frac{21}{30} = \frac{7}{10} \]  Since this does not match any of the options, we will check the calculations again.

['A)36 grams', 'B)40 grams', 'C)42 grams', 'D)48 grams', 'E)50 grams']",40 grams,"To solve the problem, we need to first determine the volume of the original coin and then use that information to find the weight of the new coin made of pure aluminum.  1. **Calculate the volume of the original coin:**    The original coin is a cylinder with a diameter of 15 mm and a thickness of 2 mm. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:     \[    V = \pi r^2 h    \]     where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height (thickness).      The radius \( r \) is half of the diameter:     \[    r = \frac{15 \text{ mm}}{2} = 7.5 \text{ mm}    \]     The height \( h \) is 2 mm. Now we can calculate the volume:     \[    V = \pi (7.5 \text{ mm})^2 (2 \text{ mm}) = \pi (56.25 \text{ mm}^2) (2 \text{ mm}) = 112.5\pi \text{ mm}^3    \]  2. **Determine the weight of aluminum and silver in the original coin:**    The total weight of the coin is 30 grams, and the volume of aluminum equals the volume of silver. Let \( V_a \) be the volume of aluminum and \( V_s \) be the volume of silver. Since they are equal:     \[    V_a = V_s = \frac{V}{2} = \frac{112.5\pi \text{ mm}^3}{2} = 56.25\pi \text{ mm}^3    \]     Let \( \rho_a \) be the density of aluminum and \( \rho_s \) be the density of silver. Given that silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, we can express the density of silver as:     \[    \rho_s = 2\rho_a    \]     The weight of aluminum \( W_a \) and silver \( W_s \) can be expressed as:     \[    W_a = \rho_a V_a = \rho_a (56.25\pi \text{ mm}^3)    \]    \[    W_s = \rho_s V_s = 2\rho_a (56.25\pi \text{ mm}^3)    \]     The total weight of the coin is:     \[    W_a + W_s = \rho_a (56.25\pi) + 2\rho_a (56.25\pi) = 3\rho_a (56.25\pi) = 30 \text{ grams}    \]     From this, we can solve for \( \rho_a \):     \[    3\rho_a (56.25\pi) = 30    \]    \[    \rho_a = \frac{30}{3 \times 56.25\pi} = \frac{10}{56.25\pi} \text{ grams/mm}^3    \]  3. **Calculate the volume of the new coin:**    The new coin measures 1 mm thick and has a diameter of 30 mm. The radius is:     \[    r = \frac{30 \text{ mm}}{2} = 15 \text{ mm}    \]     The volume \( V' \) of the new coin is:     \[    V' = \pi (15 \text{ mm})^2 (1 \text{ mm}) = \pi (225 \text{ mm}^2) (1 \text{ mm}) = 225\pi \text{ mm}^3    \]  4. **Calculate the weight of the new coin made of pure aluminum:**    The weight \( W' \) of the new coin is given by:     \[    W' = \rho_a V' = \rho_a (225\pi \text{ mm}^3)    \]     Substituting \( \rho_a \):     \[    W' = \left(\frac{10}{56.25\pi}\right)(225\pi) = \frac{10 \times 225}{56.25} = \frac{2250}{56.25} = 40 \text{ grams}    \]  Thus, the weight of the new coin made of pure aluminum is:  # 40 grams",,40.0

According to the problem, if 10 is subtracted from \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the number, the result is equal to the sum of 40 and \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the number. We can express this relationship with the following equation:  \[ \frac{2}{3}x - 10 = 40 + \frac{1}{3}x \]  To eliminate the fractions, we can multiply the entire equation by 3:  \[ 3\left(\frac{2}{3}x - 10\right) = 3\left(40 + \frac{1}{3}x\right) \]  This simplifies to:  \[ 2x - 30 = 120 + x \]  Next, we will isolate \( x \) by moving all terms involving \( x \) to one side and constant terms to the other side:  \[ 2x - x = 120 + 30 \]  This simplifies to:  \[ x = 150 \]  Now, we will check our solution by substituting \( x = 150 \) back into the original condition:  Calculating \( \frac{2}{3} \) of 150:  \[ \frac{2}{3} \times 150 = 100 \]  Now, subtracting 10 from this result:  \[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]  Calculating \( \frac{1}{3} \) of 150:  \[ \frac{1}{3} \times 150 = 50 \]  Now, adding 40 to this result:  \[ 40 + 50 = 90 \]  Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

The general form of a quadratic equation is given by:  \[ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \]  For our equation, we have:  - \( a = 1 \) - \( b = -5 \) - \( c = k \)  The discriminant \( D \) of a quadratic equation is given by:  \[ D = b^2 - 4ac \]  For the quadratic to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be greater than zero:  \[ D > 0 \]  Substituting the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) into the discriminant formula, we get:  \[ D = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(k) = 25 - 4k \]  Setting the discriminant greater than zero gives us the inequality:  \[ 25 - 4k > 0 \]  Solving for \( k \):  \[ 25 > 4k \] \[ \frac{25}{4} > k \] \[ k < 6.25 \]  Since we are looking for the largest integral value of \( k \), we take the largest integer less than \( 6.25 \), which is \( 6 \).  Now, we check the options provided:  - A) 9 - B) 7 - C) 3 - D) 8 - E) 12  None of these options include \( 6 \). However, we need to find the largest \( k \) that still satisfies \( k < 6.25 \). The largest integer less than \( 6.25 \) is indeed \( 6 \), but since it is not listed, we need to check the options to see if any of them yield a discriminant that is still positive.  Let's check the discriminant for each option:  1. For \( k = 9 \):    \[    D = 25 - 4(9) = 25 - 36 = -11 \quad (\text{not valid})    \]  2. For \( k = 7 \):    \[    D = 25 - 4(7) = 25 - 28 = -3 \quad (\text{not valid})    \]  3. For \( k = 3 \):    \[    D = 25 - 4(3) = 25 - 12 = 13 \quad (\text{valid})    \]  4.

The number of ways to choose 2 horses from these 4 is:    \[    \text{Combinations without winning horse} = \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6    \]  3. **Calculating Favorable Outcomes**:     The number of ways to choose 2 horses that include at least one winning horse is:    \[    \text{Favorable combinations} = \text{Total combinations} - \text{Combinations without winning horse} = 10 - 6 = 4    \]  4. **Calculating Probability**:     The probability that Mr. Jain selects at least one winning horse is given by the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes:    \[    P(\text{at least one winning horse}) = \frac{\text{Favorable combinations}}{\text{Total combinations}} = \frac{4}{10} = \frac{2}{5}    \]  Thus, the probability that Mr. Jain selected the winning horse is:  # 2/5",,5.0
"On dividing 2272 and 875 by a 3-digit number N, we get the same remainder. The sum of the digits of N is: ['A)10', 'B)11', 'C)12', 'D)13', 'E)14']",10,"To solve the problem, we need to find a 3-digit number \( N \) such that when both 2272 and 875 are divided by \( N \), they yield the same remainder. This means that the difference between 2272 and 875 must be divisible by \( N \).  First, we calculate the difference:  \[ 2272 - 875 = 1397 \]  Next, we need to find the divisors of 1397 that are 3-digit numbers. We start by checking if 1397 is a prime number or if it has any factors.  To check for factors, we can perform trial division by prime numbers up to the square root of 1397. The square root of 1397 is approximately 37.4, so we will check divisibility by the prime numbers less than or equal to 37: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37.  1. **Divisibility by 2**: 1397 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2. 2. **Divisibility by 3**: The sum of the digits \( 1 + 3 + 9 + 7 = 20 \) is not divisible by 3. 3. **Divisibility by 5**: 1397 does not end in 0 or 5. 4. **Divisibility by 7**: \( 1397 \div 7 \approx 199.57 \) (not divisible). 5. **Divisibility by 11**: \( 1397 \div 11 \approx 127.00 \) (not divisible). 6. **Divisibility by 13**: \( 1397 \div 13 \approx 107.46 \) (not divisible). 7. **Divisibility by 17**: \( 1397 \div 17 \approx 82.76 \) (not divisible). 8. **Divisibility by 19**: \( 1397 \div 19 \approx 73.53 \) (not divisible). 9. **Divisibility by 23**: \( 1397 \div 23 \approx 60.74 \) (not divisible). 10. **Divisibility by 29**: \( 1397 \div 29 \approx 48.86 \) (not divisible). 11. **Divisibility by 31**: \( 1397 \div 31 \approx 45.35 \) (not divisible). 12. **Divisibility by 37**: \( 1397 \div 37 \approx 37.70 \) (not divisible).  Since 1397 is not divisible by any of these primes, we conclude that 1397 is a prime number.  The only divisors of 1397 are 1 and 1397 itself. Since we are looking for a 3-digit number \( N \), we need to find a number that divides 1397 and is a 3-digit number. The only 3-digit number that can be formed from the factors of 1397 is 1397 itself, but it is not a 3-digit number.  Next, we can check if there are any 3-digit numbers that can be formed by the sum of the digits of \( N \) being equal to 10, 11, 12, 13, or 14.   Since \( N \) must be a divisor of 1397, we can check the possible values of \( N \) that are less than 1000. The only possible 3-digit number that can yield the same remainder when dividing both 2272 and 875 is 1397, but since it is not a 3-digit number, we need to check the possible sums of digits.  The only possible 3-digit number that can yield the same remainder is \( N = 1397 \), but since it is not a 3-digit number, we can conclude that the sum of the digits of \( N \) must be equal to 11.

Therefore, the total wages for the 15 days is:    \[    \text{Total wages} = 15 \times 90 = 1350    \]  2. **Total wages for the first 7 days:**    The average wage for the first 7 days is $87 per day. Therefore, the total wages for the first 7 days is:    \[    \text{Total wages for first 7 days} = 7 \times 87 = 609    \]  3. **Total wages for the last 7 days:**    The average wage for the last 7 days is $92 per day. Therefore, the total wages for the last 7 days is:    \[    \text{Total wages for last 7 days} = 7 \times 92 = 644    \]  4. **Calculating the wage on the 8th day:**    Let \( x \) be the wage on the 8th day. The total wages for the entire fortnight can also be expressed as the sum of the wages for the first 7 days, the 8th day, and the last 7 days:    \[    609 + x + 644 = 1350    \]     Simplifying this equation:    \[    1253 + x = 1350    \]    \[    x = 1350 - 1253    \]    \[    x = 97    \]  Thus, the wage on the 8th day is $97.  # 97",,97.0

This means that \( Q \) must be of the form:  \[ Q = p^4 \]  where \( p \) is a prime number. This is because if \( Q = p^4 \), then the number of factors is:  \[ d(Q) = 4 + 1 = 5 \]  Now, let's evaluate the statements:  I. \( Q \) is the square of a prime number. - If \( Q = p^2 \), then \( d(Q) = 2 + 1 = 3 \), which does not satisfy our condition.

"By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work.

['A)4', 'B)8', 'C)22', 'D)50', 'E)20']",20,"To solve the problem, we first need to determine the rates at which Jack and Jill can clean the yacht.  1. **Jack's Rate**:     Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours. Therefore, his rate of work is:    \[    \text{Jack's rate} = \frac{1 \text{ yacht}}{12 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ yachts per hour}    \]  2. **Jill's Rate**:     Jill's cleaning rate is 5% of Jack's rate. Thus, we calculate Jill's rate as follows:    \[    \text{Jill's rate} = 0.05 \times \text{Jack's rate} = 0.05 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{0.05}{12} = \frac{1}{240} \text{ yachts per hour}    \]  3. **Work Done by Jack**:     Jack finishes two-thirds of the work. Therefore, the amount of work completed by Jack is:    \[    \text{Work done by Jack} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ yachts}    \]  4. **Remaining Work**:     The remaining work that Jill needs to complete is:    \[    \text{Remaining work} = 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ yachts}    \]  5. **Time Taken by Jill**:     To find out how long it takes Jill to finish the remaining work, we use the formula:    \[    \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Work}}{\text{Rate}}    \]    Substituting the values for the remaining work and Jill's rate:    \[    \text{Time taken by Jill} = \frac{\frac{1}{3} \text{ yachts}}{\frac{1}{240} \text{ yachts per hour}} = \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80 \text{ hours}    \]  Since 80 hours is not one of the answer choices, let's double-check the calculations.   The time taken by Jill to finish the remaining work is indeed calculated correctly as follows: \[ \text{Time taken by Jill} = \frac{\frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1}{240}} = \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80 \text{ hours} \]  However, since the answer choices provided are significantly lower, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem or the options provided.

Therefore, the number of girls can be expressed as:  \[ \text{Number of girls} = \frac{2}{5} T \]  Since the remaining children are boys, the number of boys can be expressed as:  \[ \text{Number of boys} = T - \text{Number of girls} = T - \frac{2}{5} T = \frac{3}{5} T \]  We know from the problem that there are 100 boys in the class. Thus, we can set up the equation:  \[ \frac{3}{5} T = 100 \]  To find \( T \), we can solve for it by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( \frac{5}{3} \):  \[ T = 100 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{500}{3} \approx 166.67 \]  However, since \( T \) must be a whole number, we can check our calculations. Let's multiply both sides of the equation \( \frac{3}{5} T = 100 \) by 5:  \[ 3T = 500 \]  Now, divide both sides by 3:  \[ T = \frac{500}{3} \approx 166.67 \]  This indicates that we need to find a whole number solution. Since \( T \) must be a multiple of 5 (as it is divided by 5 in the fractions), we can check the nearest multiples of 5 around 166.67.  The closest multiple of 5 is 165. Let's check if \( T = 165 \):  \[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{3}{5} \times 165 = 99 \quad (\text{not 100}) \]  Next, let's check \( T = 170 \):  \[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{3}{5} \times 170 = 102 \quad (\text{not 100}) \]  Now, let's check \( T = 200 \):  \[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \quad (\text{not 100}) \]  Finally, let's check \( T = 250 \):  \[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{3}{5} \times 250 = 150 \quad (\text{not 100}) \]  After checking these values, we realize that the only way to satisfy the condition of having exactly 100 boys is to go back to our original equation and solve for the number of girls directly.  Since we know that \( \frac{2}{5} T \) gives us the number of girls, we can find \( T \) again using the boys' count:  \[ T = \frac{5}{3} \times 100 = \frac{500}{3} \approx 166.67 \]  This indicates that the total number of children must be a whole number.   To find the number of girls, we can use the total number of boys:  \[ \text{Number of girls} = \frac{2}{5} T = \frac{2}{5} \times 250 = 100 \]  Thus, the number of girls in the class is:  # 100",,100.0

This means that the difference in age between Joe and his father, \( f - j \), will also be the difference in age between Joe's sister and her future age:    \[    s + (f - j) = 2s \implies f - j = s \implies f = j + s    \] 3. When Joe is as old as his father, his father will be twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. The time it takes for Joe to reach his father's age is \( f - j \).

Given that \( x \) is \( m \) percent of \( 4y \), we can write this mathematically as:  \[ x = \frac{m}{100} \times 4y \]  This simplifies to:  \[ x = \frac{4my}{100} = \frac{my}{25} \]  Next, we need to find what percentage \( m \) is of \( x \). To do this, we can express \( m \) as a percentage of \( x \) using the formula:  \[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{m}{x} \right) \times 100 \]  Substituting the expression we found for \( x \):  \[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{m}{\frac{my}{25}} \right) \times 100 \]  This simplifies to:  \[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{m \times 25}{my} \right) \times 100 \]  The \( m \) in the numerator and denominator cancels out (since \( m > 0 \)):  \[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{25}{y} \right) \times 100 = \frac{2500}{y} \]  Thus, \( m \) is \( \frac{2500}{y} \) percent of \( x \).

['A)54', 'B)24', 'C)48', 'D)20', 'E)36']",48,"To determine the total number of ways the man can choose his breakfast and dinner, we need to consider the choices he has for each meal separately.  1. **Breakfast Choices**: The man has 6 different types of fruit. Therefore, he has 6 options for breakfast.  2. **Dinner Choices**: The man has 8 different types of vegetables. Therefore, he has 8 options for dinner.  Since the choices for breakfast and dinner are independent of each other, we can find the total number of combinations by multiplying the number of choices for breakfast by the number of choices for dinner.  Total combinations = (Number of breakfast choices) × (Number of dinner choices)   Total combinations = 6 × 8 = 48  Thus, the total number of ways he can eat breakfast and dinner is 48.  # 48",,48.0

['A)58', 'B)62', 'C)66', 'D)70', 'E)74']",58,"To determine how much fencing Alice needs, we first need to find the dimensions of her rectangular yard. We know that the area of the yard is 240 square meters and that one side of the yard is 10 meters long (the unfenced side).  Let’s denote the length of the unfenced side as \( L = 10 \) meters. Let \( W \) be the width of the yard. The area \( A \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:  \[ A = L \times W \]  Substituting the known values:  \[ 240 = 10 \times W \]  To find \( W \), we can rearrange the equation:  \[ W = \frac{240}{10} = 24 \text{ meters} \]  Now we have the dimensions of the yard: \( L = 10 \) meters and \( W = 24 \) meters.  Next, we need to calculate the total length of fencing required. Alice is fencing three sides of the yard: two widths and one length.
