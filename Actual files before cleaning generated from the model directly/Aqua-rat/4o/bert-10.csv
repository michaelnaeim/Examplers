"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?

Let: - \( h \) be the height of the tower. - \( d \) be the distance from the car to the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 45°. - \( v \) be the speed of the car.  ### Step 1: Determine the height of the tower  When the angle of elevation is 45°, we have: \[ \tan(45°) = \frac{h}{d} \implies h = d \]  When the angle of elevation changes to 60°, we have: \[ \tan(60°) = \frac{h}{d'} \implies h = d' \sqrt{3} \] where \( d' \) is the new distance from the car to the base of the tower.  ### Step 2: Relate the distances  From the two equations for \( h \): 1. \( h = d \) 2. \( h = d' \sqrt{3} \)  Setting them equal gives: \[ d = d' \sqrt{3} \implies d' = \frac{d}{\sqrt{3}} \]  ### Step 3: Determine the distance traveled by the car  The car travels from distance \( d \) to distance \( d' \) in 10 minutes. The distance traveled by the car in this time is: \[ d - d' = d - \frac{d}{\sqrt{3}} = d \left(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = d \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) \]  ### Step 4: Calculate the speed of the car  The speed of the car \( v \) can be expressed as: \[ v = \frac{d - d'}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{d \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10} \]  ### Step 5: Determine the remaining distance to the tower  The remaining distance to the tower when the angle is 60° is: \[ d' = \frac{d}{\sqrt{3}} \]  ### Step 6: Calculate the time to reach the base of the tower  The time \( t \) to reach the base of the tower from distance \( d' \) is given by: \[ t = \frac{d'}{v} \]  Substituting \( d' \) and \( v \): \[ t = \frac{\frac{d}{\sqrt{3}}}{\frac{d \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10}} = \frac{\frac{d}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot 10}{d \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \]  ### Step 7: Simplify the expression  To simplify \( \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \), we can multiply the numerator and denominator by \( \sqrt{3} + 1 \): \[ t = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1)} = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1} = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{2} = 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) \]  Thus, the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower after the angle of elevation has changed to 60° is:  # 5(√3 + 1)",,1.0

The item is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price can be calculated as:    \[    \text{Discounted Price} = P - 0.22P = 0.78P    \]  2. The customer uses a $20-off coupon on the discounted price, so the final price paid by the customer is:    \[    \text{Final Price} = 0.78P - 20    \]  3. According to the problem, the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price. Therefore, we can express this as:    \[    0.78P - 20 = \frac{P}{2} + 1.90    \]  4. Now, we will solve for \( P \). First, rearranging the equation gives:    \[    0.78P - \frac{P}{2} = 20 + 1.90    \]    \[    0.78P - 0.5P = 21.90    \]    \[    0.28P = 21.90    \]  5.

The prime factorization of each number is: - \( 16 = 2^4 \) - \( 10 = 2^1 \times 5^1 \) - \( 8 = 2^3 \)  The LCM is obtained by taking the highest power of each prime: - For \( 2 \), the highest power is \( 2^4 \). - For \( 5 \), the highest power is \( 5^1 \).  Thus, the LCM is: \[ \text{LCM} = 2^4 \times 5^1 = 16 \times 5 = 80 \]  This means \( N \) must be a multiple of 80. Since \( N \) is a four-digit number, we can find the range of four-digit numbers that are multiples of 80.  The smallest four-digit number is 1000, and the largest is 9999. We can find the smallest multiple of 80 that is greater than or equal to 1000 by calculating: \[ \lceil \frac{1000}{80} \rceil = \lceil 12.5 \rceil = 13 \] Thus, the smallest four-digit multiple of 80 is: \[ 80 \times 13 = 1040 \]  Next, we find the largest multiple of 80 that is less than or equal to 9999: \[ \lfloor \frac{9999}{80} \rfloor = \lfloor 124.9875 \rfloor = 124 \] Thus, the largest four-digit multiple of 80 is: \[ 80 \times 124 = 9920 \]  Now we have the smallest and largest four-digit multiples of 80: - Minimum \( N = 1040 \) - Maximum \( N = 9920 \)  To find the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students: \[ \text{Difference} = 9920 - 1040 = 8880 \]  Thus, the final answer is:  # 8880",,8880.0

Now, substituting the values into the formula:  \[ SI = \frac{500 \times 6 \times 4}{100} \]  Calculating the numerator:  \[ 500 \times 6 = 3000 \] \[ 3000 \times 4 = 12000 \]  Now, divide by 100:  \[ SI = \frac{12000}{100} = 120 \]  Now, to find the total amount \( A \) that Rahul will pay after 4 years, we add the simple interest to the principal:  \[ A = P + SI = 500 + 120 = 620 \]  Thus, the total amount Rahul will pay to clear the debt after 4 years is:  # 620",,620.0
"A computer routine was developed to generate two numbers (x,y) the first being a random number between 0 and 100 inclusive, and the second being less than or equal to the square root of the first. Each of the following pair satisfies the routine except ['A)(99,10)', 'B)(85,9)', 'C)(50,7)', 'D)(1,1)', 'E)(1,0)']","(99,10)","To determine which pair does not satisfy the routine, we need to analyze each pair (x, y) based on the conditions given:  1. The first number \( x \) must be between 0 and 100 inclusive. 2. The second number \( y \) must be less than or equal to the square root of \( x \) (i.e., \( y \leq \sqrt{x} \)).  Now, let's evaluate each option:  **A) (99, 10)**   - \( x = 99 \)   - \( \sqrt{99} \approx 9.95 \)   - \( y = 10 \)   - Since \( 10 > 9.95 \), this pair does not satisfy the condition.  **B) (85, 9)**   - \( x = 85 \)   - \( \sqrt{85} \approx 9.22 \)   - \( y = 9 \)   - Since \( 9 \leq 9.22 \), this pair satisfies the condition.  **C) (50, 7)**   - \( x = 50 \)   - \( \sqrt{50} \approx 7.07 \)   - \( y = 7 \)   - Since \( 7 \leq 7.07 \), this pair satisfies the condition.  **D) (1, 1)**   - \( x = 1 \)   - \( \sqrt{1} = 1 \)   - \( y = 1 \)   - Since \( 1 \leq 1 \), this pair satisfies the condition.  **E) (1, 0)**   - \( x = 1 \)   - \( \sqrt{1} = 1 \)   - \( y = 0 \)   - Since \( 0 \leq 1 \), this pair satisfies the condition.  After evaluating all pairs, we find that the only pair that does not satisfy the routine is:  **A) (99, 10)**  Thus, the final answer is:  # A",,10.0
"A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep? ['A)126km', 'B)144km', 'C)127km', 'D)228km', 'E)128km']",144km,"Let the speed of the jeep during the forward journey be \( v \) km/hr. The distance travelled in the forward journey can be expressed as:  \[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]  For the forward journey, the time taken is 6 hours, so the distance \( d \) can be written as:  \[ d = v \times 6 \]  During the return journey, the speed of the jeep increases by 12 km/hr, making the speed for the return journey \( v + 12 \) km/hr. The time taken for the return journey is 4 hours, so the distance can also be expressed as:  \[ d = (v + 12) \times 4 \]  Since both expressions represent the same distance \( d \), we can set them equal to each other:  \[ v \times 6 = (v + 12) \times 4 \]  Expanding the right side:  \[ 6v = 4v + 48 \]  Now, we can isolate \( v \) by subtracting \( 4v \) from both sides:  \[ 6v - 4v = 48 \]  This simplifies to:  \[ 2v = 48 \]  Dividing both sides by 2 gives:  \[ v = 24 \text{ km/hr} \]  Now, we can find the distance \( d \) using the speed from the forward journey:  \[ d = v \times 6 = 24 \times 6 = 144 \text{ km} \]  Thus, the distance travelled by the jeep is:  # 144km",,144.0

"The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost? ['A)20%', 'B)28%', 'C)36%', 'D)40%', 'E)42%']",28%,"Let the wholesale cost of the appliance be denoted as \( W \).  The original retail price (R) is 60% more than the wholesale cost. Therefore, we can express the original retail price as:  \[ R = W + 0.6W = 1.6W \]  Next, the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price. The selling price (S) can be calculated as:  \[ S = R - 0.2R = 0.8R \]  Substituting the expression for \( R \):  \[ S = 0.8 \times 1.6W = 1.28W \]  Now, we need to determine how much more the selling price is compared to the wholesale cost. To find the percentage increase from the wholesale cost to the selling price, we can use the formula for percentage increase:  \[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{S - W}{W} \right) \times 100\% \]  Substituting \( S = 1.28W \):  \[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{1.28W - W}{W} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.28W}{W} \right) \times 100\% = 28\% \]  Thus, the appliance was sold for 28% more than its wholesale cost.

"When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet. ['A)1584', 'B)1120', 'C)792', 'D)1320', 'E)1200']",1120,"Let the dimensions of the rectangular sheet be \( l \) (length) and \( w \) (width).  When the sheet is folded along one set of sides (let's say the length), the perimeter of each part is given as 48 cm. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as:  \[ P = 2(l + w) \]  When folded along the length, the new dimensions become \( \frac{l}{2} \) and \( w \). Therefore, the perimeter of the folded part is:  \[ P = 2\left(\frac{l}{2} + w\right) = 2\left(\frac{l}{2} + w\right) = l + 2w \]  Setting this equal to 48 cm, we have:  \[ l + 2w = 48 \quad \text{(1)} \]  When the sheet is folded along the width, the new dimensions become \( l \) and \( \frac{w}{2} \). The perimeter of this folded part is:  \[ P = 2\left(l + \frac{w}{2}\right) = 2l + w \]  Setting this equal to 66 cm, we have:  \[ 2l + w = 66 \quad \text{(2)} \]  Now we have a system of two equations:  1. \( l + 2w = 48 \) 2. \( 2l + w = 66 \)  We can solve this system step by step. First, we can express \( w \) from equation (1):  \[ w = \frac{48 - l}{2} \quad \text{(3)} \]  Now, substitute equation (3) into equation (2):  \[ 2l + \frac{48 - l}{2} = 66 \]  To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:  \[ 4l + 48 - l = 132 \]  Combine like terms:  \[ 3l + 48 = 132 \]  Subtract 48 from both sides:  \[ 3l = 84 \]  Now, divide by 3:  \[ l = 28 \]  Now substitute \( l = 28 \) back into equation (3) to find \( w \):  \[ w = \frac{48 - 28}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]  Now we have the dimensions of the rectangular sheet: \( l = 28 \) cm and \( w = 10 \) cm.  To find the area \( A \) of the rectangular sheet, we use the formula:  \[ A = l \times w = 28 \times 10 = 280 \text{ cm}^2 \]  However, it seems I made a mistake in the calculations. Let's check the area again:  The area of the rectangle is:  \[ A = l \times w = 28 \times 10 = 280 \text{ cm}^2 \]  But we need to find the area of the entire sheet, which is:  \[ A = l \times w = 28 \times 10 = 280 \text{ cm}^2 \]  This does not match any of the options provided. Let's check the calculations again.  The correct area calculation should be:  \[ A = l \times w = 28 \times 10 = 280 \text{ cm}^2 \]  This is not matching the options provided.

['A)24', 'B)36', 'C)72', 'D)84', 'E)None']",36,"To find the total number of ways to travel from place M to place Q, we need to consider the number of choices available for each segment of the journey.  1. **From M to N**: There are 3 buses available. 2. **From N to O**: There are 4 buses available. 3. **From O to P**: There is 1 bus available. 4. **From P to Q**: There are 3 buses available.  To find the total number of ways to travel from M to Q, we multiply the number of choices for each segment:  \[ \text{Total ways} = (\text{ways from M to N}) \times (\text{ways from N to O}) \times (\text{ways from O to P}) \times (\text{ways from P to Q}) \]  Substituting the values we have:  \[ \text{Total ways} = 3 \times 4 \times 1 \times 3 \]  Calculating this step-by-step:  1. \(3 \times 4 = 12\) 2. \(12 \times 1 = 12\) 3. \(12 \times 3 = 36\)  Thus, the total number of ways to travel from M to Q is 36.

The formula for the diagonal \( d \) of a rectangular solid with dimensions \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) is given by:  \[ d = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} \]  In this case, the dimensions of the rectangular solid are \( a = 3 \), \( b = 4 \), and \( c = 15 \). We can substitute these values into the formula:  \[ d = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2} \]  Calculating each term:  \[ 3^2 = 9 \] \[ 4^2 = 16 \] \[ 15^2 = 225 \]  Now, we sum these values:  \[ 9 + 16 + 225 = 250 \]  Next, we take the square root of the sum:  \[ d = \sqrt{250} \]  To simplify \( \sqrt{250} \):  \[ \sqrt{250} = \sqrt{25 \times 10} = 5\sqrt{10} \]  Now, we need to find the diameter of the sphere. The diameter \( D \) of the sphere is equal to the diagonal of the rectangular solid:  \[ D = d = 5\sqrt{10} \]  Next, we calculate \( 5\sqrt{10} \). The approximate value of \( \sqrt{10} \) is about \( 3.1623 \):  \[ D \approx 5 \times 3.1623 \approx 15.8115 \]  Now, we can round this to four decimal places:  \[ D \approx 15.8113 \]  Thus, the diameter of the sphere is:  # 15.8113",,15.8113

When the shopkeeper gives a discount of 5%, the selling price \( S_1 \) is: \[ S_1 = M - 0.05M = 0.95M \]  When the shopkeeper gives a discount of 7%, the selling price \( S_2 \) is: \[ S_2 = M - 0.07M = 0.93M \]  According to the problem, the profit when selling at a 5% discount is \( S_1 - C \), and the profit when selling at a 7% discount is \( S_2 - C \). The difference in profit between the two selling prices is given as Rs. 15: \[ (S_1 - C) - (S_2 - C) = 15 \] This simplifies to: \[ S_1 - S_2 = 15 \]  Substituting the expressions for \( S_1 \) and \( S_2 \): \[ 0.95M - 0.93M = 15 \] \[ 0.02M = 15 \]  Now, solving for \( M \): \[ M = \frac{15}{0.02} = 750 \]  Thus, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 750.  # 750",,750.0

The least common multiple of 8 and 18 is 72.  Now, we convert both fractions: \[ \frac{7}{8} = \frac{7 \times 9}{8 \times 9} = \frac{63}{72} \] \[ \frac{7}{18} = \frac{7 \times 4}{18 \times 4} = \frac{28}{72} \]  Now we can rewrite the difference: \[ \left| \frac{63}{72} x - \frac{28}{72} x \right| = 770 \] \[ \left| \frac{63 - 28}{72} x \right| = 770 \] \[ \left| \frac{35}{72} x \right| = 770 \]  Since \( x \) is a positive number, we can drop the absolute value: \[ \frac{35}{72} x = 770 \]  To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{72}{35} \): \[ x = 770 \times \frac{72}{35} \]  Calculating \( 770 \times \frac{72}{35} \): \[ x = 770 \times 2.05714285714 \quad (\text{since } \frac{72}{35} \approx 2.05714285714) \] \[ x = 1584 \]  Thus, the number is: # 1584",,1584.0

['A)384', 'B)562', 'C)458', 'D)156', 'E)452']",384,"To find the average speed of the airplane flying around the square, we first need to determine the total distance traveled and the total time taken.  Let's denote the side length of the square as \( s \). The total distance traveled around the square is the perimeter, which is given by:  \[ \text{Total Distance} = 4s \]  Next, we will calculate the time taken to travel each side of the square at the given speeds.  1. For the first side at 200 km/hr:    \[    \text{Time}_1 = \frac{s}{200}    \]  2. For the second side at 400 km/hr:    \[    \text{Time}_2 = \frac{s}{400}    \]  3. For the third side at 600 km/hr:    \[    \text{Time}_3 = \frac{s}{600}    \]  4. For the fourth side at 800 km/hr:    \[    \text{Time}_4 = \frac{s}{800}    \]  Now, we can find the total time taken to complete the circuit:  \[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_1 + \text{Time}_2 + \text{Time}_3 + \text{Time}_4 \]  Substituting the expressions for time:  \[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{s}{200} + \frac{s}{400} + \frac{s}{600} + \frac{s}{800} \]  To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 200, 400, 600, and 800 is 2400. We can rewrite each term:  \[ \frac{s}{200} = \frac{12s}{2400}, \quad \frac{s}{400} = \frac{6s}{2400}, \quad \frac{s}{600} = \frac{4s}{2400}, \quad \frac{s}{800} = \frac{3s}{2400} \]  Now, adding these fractions together:  \[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{12s + 6s + 4s + 3s}{2400} = \frac{25s}{2400} \]  Now we can simplify this:  \[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{s}{96} \]  Now we have the total distance and total time:  - Total Distance = \( 4s \) - Total Time = \( \frac{s}{96} \)  The average speed \( V_{avg} \) is given by the formula:  \[ V_{avg} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{4s}{\frac{s}{96}} = 4s \cdot \frac{96}{s} = 384 \text{ km/hr} \]  Thus, the average speed of the airplane around the square is:  # 384",,384.0

From the problem, we have the following two equations:  1. The total number of sharpeners:    \[    w + b = 18    \]  2. The cost relationship, where the cost of each brown sharpener is \( x \) rupees, and the cost of each white sharpener is \( x + 1 \) rupees. The total cost is given as 100 rupees:    \[    wx + b(x + 1) = 100    \]    This can be rewritten as:    \[    wx + bx + b = 100    \]    Simplifying this gives:    \[    (w + b)x + b = 100    \]    Since \( w + b = 18 \), we can substitute this into the equation:    \[    18x + b = 100    \]  Now we have two equations: 1. \( w + b = 18 \) 2. \( 18x + b = 100 \)  From the first equation, we can express \( b \) in terms of \( w \): \[ b = 18 - w \]  Substituting this into the second equation: \[ 18x + (18 - w) = 100 \] This simplifies to: \[ 18x - w + 18 = 100 \] Rearranging gives: \[ 18x - w = 82 \] Thus, we can express \( w \) in terms of \( x \): \[ w = 18x - 82 \]  Now, since \( w \) must be a non-negative integer, we need \( 18x - 82 \geq 0 \): \[ 18x \geq 82 \implies x \geq \frac{82}{18} \approx 4.56 \] Since \( x \) must be an integer, the smallest possible value for \( x \) is 5.  Now, let's check \( x = 5 \): \[ w = 18(5) - 82 = 90 - 82 = 8 \] Then, substituting \( w = 8 \) back into the first equation to find \( b \): \[ b = 18 - 8 = 10 \]  Now, let's verify the cost: - Cost of white sharpeners: \( 8 \times 6 = 48 \) (since \( x + 1 = 6 \)) - Cost of brown sharpeners: \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \)  Total cost: \[ 48 + 50 = 98 \quad \text{(not equal to 100)} \]  Next, let's try \( x = 6 \): \[ w = 18(6) - 82 = 108 - 82 = 26 \quad \text{(not possible since } w + b = 18\text{)} \]  Next, let's try \( x = 4 \): \[ w = 18(4) - 82 = 72 - 82 = -10 \quad \text{(not possible)} \]  Next, let's try \( x = 7 \): \[ w = 18(7) - 82 = 126 - 82 = 44 \quad \text{(not possible)} \]  Next, let's try \( x = 8 \): \[ w = 18(8) - 82 = 144 - 82 = 62 \quad \text{(not possible)} \]  Next, let's try \( x = 3 \): \[ w = 18(3) - 82 = 54 - 82 = -28 \quad \text{(not possible)} \]  Next, let's try \( x = 2 \): \[ w = 18(2) - 82 = 36 - 82 = -46 \quad \text{(not possible)} \]  Next, let's try \( x = 1 \): \[ w = 18(1) - 82 = 18 - 82 = -64 \quad \text{(not possible)} \]  Next, let's try \( x = 0 \): \[ w = 18(0) - 82 = 0 - 82 = -82 \quad \text{(not possible)} \]  After checking all possible values, we find that the only valid solution is \( w = 10 \) and \( b = 8 \).

Therefore, the rate of hose A is:    \[    \text{Rate of A} = \frac{1 \text{ pool}}{8 \text{ hours}} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ pools per hour}    \]  2. **Calculate the Amount Filled by Hose A in 2 Hours:**    In the first 2 hours, hose A fills:    \[    \text{Amount filled by A in 2 hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \times \frac{1}{8} \text{ pools per hour} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ of the pool}    \]  3. **Determine the Remaining Volume of the Pool:**    After hose A has worked for 2 hours, the remaining volume of the pool is:    \[    \text{Remaining volume} = 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ of the pool}    \]  4. **Calculate the Time Taken by Both Hoses Together:**    Hose A and hose B together finish filling the remaining \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the pool in 3 hours. Therefore, their combined rate is:    \[    \text{Combined rate} = \frac{\text{Remaining volume}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{\frac{3}{4}}{3} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ pools per hour}    \]  5. **Set Up the Equation for Hose B's Rate:**    Let the rate of hose B be \( r_B \) pools per hour. The combined rate of hoses A and B is:    \[    \text{Rate of A} + \text{Rate of B} = \frac{1}{8} + r_B = \frac{1}{4}    \]  6. **Solve for Hose B's Rate:**    Rearranging the equation gives:    \[    r_B = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8}    \]    To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator (which is 8):    \[    r_B = \frac{2}{8} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ pools per hour}    \]  7. **Determine the Time for Hose B to Fill the Pool Alone:**    If hose B fills at a rate of \(\frac{1}{8}\) pools per hour, the time it would take hose B to fill the entire pool alone is:    \[    \text{Time} = \frac{1 \text{ pool}}{r_B} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{8}} = 8 \text{ hours}    \]  Thus, the time it would take hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool is:  # 8",,8.0

['A)4', 'B)5', 'C)7', 'D)6', 'E)8']",5,"To solve the problem, we first need to determine how many toys are in one box and then how many boxes are needed to lift a total of 29,400 toys.  1. **Calculate the number of toys in one box:**    - There are 5 dozen toys in one box.    - Since 1 dozen equals 12, we have:      \[      5 \text{ dozen} = 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ toys}      \]  2. **Calculate the total number of toys in 98 boxes:**    - If one box contains 60 toys, then 98 boxes contain:      \[      98 \text{ boxes} \times 60 \text{ toys/box} = 5880 \text{ toys}      \]  3. **Determine how many boxes are needed to lift 29,400 toys:**    - To find out how many boxes are required to lift 29,400 toys, we divide the total number of toys by the number of toys per box:      \[      \text{Number of boxes needed} = \frac{29400 \text{ toys}}{60 \text{ toys/box}} = 490 \text{ boxes}      \]  4. **Calculate how many tempos are needed to lift 490 boxes:**    - Since each tempo can carry 98 boxes, we find the number of tempos required by dividing the total number of boxes by the number of boxes each tempo can carry:      \[      \text{Number of tempos needed} = \frac{490 \text{ boxes}}{98 \text{ boxes/tempo}} = 5 \text{ tempos}      \]  Thus, the final answer is:  # 5",,5.0
"There are 10 oranges in a basket. Find the no. of ways in which 2 oranges are chosen from the basket? ['A)45', 'B)90', 'C)120', 'D)150', 'E)180']",45,"To find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges, we can use the combination formula, which is given by:  \[ C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \]  where: - \( n \) is the total number of items (in this case, oranges), - \( r \) is the number of items to choose, - \( ! \) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.  In this problem, we have: - \( n = 10 \) (the total number of oranges), - \( r = 2 \) (the number of oranges we want to choose).  Now, we can substitute these values into the combination formula:  \[ C(10, 2) = \frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = \frac{10!}{2! \cdot 8!} \]  Next, we can simplify this expression. The factorial \( 10! \) can be expressed as \( 10 \times 9 \times 8! \), allowing us to cancel \( 8! \) in the numerator and denominator:  \[ C(10, 2) = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8!}{2! \cdot 8!} = \frac{10 \times 9}{2!} \]  Now, we calculate \( 2! \):  \[ 2! = 2 \times 1 = 2 \]  Substituting this back into our equation gives:  \[ C(10, 2) = \frac{10 \times 9}{2} = \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]  Thus, the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges is 45.

['A)438', 'B)550', 'C)500', 'D)450', 'E)498']",438,"To solve the problem, we first need to understand the structure of the hollow cube and how many smaller cubes are involved.  1. **Dimensions of the hollow cube**:    - The outer size of the cube is 5 cm.    - The thickness of the cube is 1 cm.    - Therefore, the inner size of the hollow cube is \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 3\) cm.  2. **Volume of the outer cube**:    - The volume of the outer cube (5 cm) is calculated as:    \[    V_{\text{outer}} = 5^3 = 125 \text{ cm}^3    \]  3. **Volume of the inner cube**:    - The volume of the inner cube (3 cm) is calculated as:    \[    V_{\text{inner}} = 3^3 = 27 \text{ cm}^3    \]  4. **Volume of the material used**:    - The volume of the material used to create the hollow cube is:    \[    V_{\text{material}} = V_{\text{outer}} - V_{\text{inner}} = 125 - 27 = 98 \text{ cm}^3    \]  5. **Number of smaller cubes**:    - Each smaller cube has a size of 1 cm³, so the total number of smaller cubes used in the hollow cube is:    \[    N_{\text{total}} = V_{\text{material}} = 98    \]  6. **Faces of the smaller cubes**:    - Each smaller cube has 6 faces. Therefore, the total number of faces of all smaller cubes is:    \[    N_{\text{faces}} = 98 \times 6 = 588    \]  7. **Faces that are painted**:    - The outer surface of the hollow cube is painted. The outer layer of smaller cubes that are exposed to the outer surface will have their faces painted.    - The outer layer consists of the cubes on the outermost layer of the 5 cm cube. The inner layer consists of the cubes that form the 3 cm cube.     - The number of smaller cubes in the outer layer can be calculated as follows:      - The outer layer of the 5 cm cube has \(5^3 = 125\) total cubes.      - The inner layer of the 3 cm cube has \(3^3 = 27\) cubes.      - Therefore, the number of smaller cubes in the outer layer is:      \[      N_{\text{outer layer}} = 125 - 27 = 98      \]  8. **Unpainted faces**:    - The smaller cubes in the inner layer (3 cm cube) will have all their faces unpainted. The number of smaller cubes in the inner layer is 27.    - Each of these inner cubes has 6 faces, so the total number of unpainted faces is:    \[    N_{\text{unpainted faces}} = 27 \times 6 = 162    \]  9. **Total unpainted faces**:    - The unpainted faces of the outer layer cubes need to be considered. Each of the 98 outer layer cubes has 1 face painted (the one facing outward), and the remaining 5 faces are unpainted.    - Therefore, the total number of unpainted faces from the outer layer is:    \[    N_{\text{outer unpainted faces}} = 98 \times 5 = 490    \]  10. **Total unpainted faces**:    - The total number of unpainted faces is the sum of the unpainted faces from the inner layer and the outer layer:    \[    N_{\text{total unpainted faces}} = 162 + 490 = 652    \]  However, we need to find the number of smaller cubes that remain unpainted, not the faces.

['A)1%', 'B)2%', 'C)5%', 'D)9%', 'E)10%']",9%,"Let's break down the problem step by step.  1. **Determine the percentage of cocoa and vanilla chocolates:**    - We know that 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored. Therefore, the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates is:      \[      100\% - 10\% = 90\%      \]  2. **Determine the percentage of squashed chocolates:**    - It is given that 90% of the vanilla chocolates are squashed. Since 90% of the chocolates are vanilla, we can calculate the percentage of squashed chocolates as follows:      \[      \text{Percentage of squashed chocolates} = 90\% \text{ of } 90\% = 0.9 \times 90\% = 81\%      \]  3. **Determine the percentage of chocolates that are not squashed:**    - Since 81% of the chocolates are squashed, the percentage of chocolates that are not squashed is:      \[      100\% - 81\% = 19\%      \]  4. **Determine the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed:**    - We know that 90% of the chocolates are vanilla flavored. Since 90% of the vanilla chocolates are squashed, it follows that 10% of the vanilla chocolates are not squashed. Therefore, the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is:      \[      10\% \text{ of } 90\% = 0.1 \times 90\% = 9\%      \]  Thus, the final answer is:  # 9%",,9.0

However, on the day the frog reaches or exceeds the top of the well, it will not fall back down.   3. **Calculating Days**: The well is 30 meters deep. We need to determine how many days it takes for the frog to reach a point where it can jump out of the well.     - After 27 days, the frog will have made a net progress of:    \[    27 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ m/day} = 27 \text{ m}    \]    - On the 28th day, the frog jumps up 3 meters from 27 meters:    \[    27 \text{ m} + 3 \text{ m} = 30 \text{ m}    \]    At this point, the frog reaches the top of the well and does not fall back.  4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, it takes the frog a total of 28 days to come out of the well.

"The sum of the 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square, which of the following can be one of these 5 numbers? ['A)47', 'B)91', 'C)41', 'D)67', 'E)44']",41,"Let the five consecutive two-digit odd numbers be represented as \( n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8 \). The sum of these numbers can be calculated as follows:  \[ \text{Sum} = n + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) + (n+8) = 5n + 20 \]  Next, we need to find the condition under which this sum, when divided by 10, becomes a perfect square:  \[ \frac{5n + 20}{10} = \frac{5(n + 4)}{10} = \frac{n + 4}{2} \]  For \( \frac{n + 4}{2} \) to be a perfect square, \( n + 4 \) must be an even number (since it is being divided by 2). Since \( n \) is an odd number, \( n + 4 \) is indeed even. Let’s denote \( \frac{n + 4}{2} = k^2 \) for some integer \( k \):  \[ n + 4 = 2k^2 \implies n = 2k^2 - 4 \]  Now, we need to ensure that \( n \) is a two-digit odd number. The range for \( n \) as a two-digit odd number is from 11 to 99. Therefore, we have:  \[ 11 \leq 2k^2 - 4 \leq 99 \]  Adding 4 to all parts of the inequality gives:  \[ 15 \leq 2k^2 \leq 103 \]  Dividing the entire inequality by 2 results in:  \[ 7.5 \leq k^2 \leq 51.5 \]  Since \( k^2 \) must be a perfect square, the possible values for \( k^2 \) are 9, 16, 25, 36, 49. This corresponds to \( k = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \).  Now we will calculate \( n \) for each valid \( k \):  1. For \( k = 3 \):    \[    n = 2(9) - 4 = 18 - 4 = 14 \quad (\text{not odd})    \]  2. For \( k = 4 \):    \[    n = 2(16) - 4 = 32 - 4 = 28 \quad (\text{not odd})    \]  3. For \( k = 5 \):    \[    n = 2(25) - 4 = 50 - 4 = 46 \quad (\text{not odd})    \]  4. For \( k = 6 \):    \[    n = 2(36) - 4 = 72 - 4 = 68 \quad (\text{not odd})    \]  5. For \( k = 7 \):    \[    n = 2(49) - 4 = 98 - 4 = 94 \quad (\text{not odd})    \]  None of the values of \( n \) calculated from \( k = 3 \) to \( k = 7 \) yield an odd number.   Now, let's check the possible odd numbers from the options given: 41, 47, 67, and 91. We will check if any of these can be expressed as \( n = 2k^2 - 4 \).  1. For \( n = 41 \):    \[    41 + 4 = 45 \implies \frac{45}{2} = 22.5 \quad (\text{not a perfect square})    \]  2. For \( n = 47 \):    \[    47 + 4 = 51 \implies \frac{51}{2} = 25.5 \quad (\text{not a perfect square})    \]  3. For \( n = 67 \):    \[    67 + 4 = 71 \implies \frac{71}{2} = 35.5 \quad (\text{not a perfect square})    \]  4. For \( n = 91 \):    \[    91 + 4 = 95 \implies \frac{95}{2} = 47.5 \quad (\text{not a perfect square})    \]  None of the options yield a perfect square when \( n + 4 \) is divided by 2.   However, we can check the sum of the five consecutive odd numbers starting from each of the options to see if any of them yield a perfect square when divided by 10.  Let's check the sum for \( n = 41 \): - The numbers are 41, 43, 45, 47, 49. - The sum is \( 41 + 43 + 45 + 47 + 49 = 225 \). - Dividing by 10 gives \( 22.5 \) (not a perfect square).  Next, for \( n = 47 \): - The numbers are 47, 49, 51, 53, 55. - The sum is \( 47 + 49 + 51 + 53 + 55 = 255 \). - Dividing by 10 gives \( 25.5 \) (not a perfect square).  Next, for \( n = 67 \): - The numbers are 67, 69, 71, 73, 75. - The sum is \( 67 + 69 + 71 + 73 + 75 = 355 \). - Dividing by 10 gives \( 35.5 \) (not a perfect square).  Next, for \( n = 91 \): - The numbers are 91, 93, 95, 97, 99. - The sum is \( 91 + 93 + 95 + 97 + 99 = 475 \). - Dividing by 10 gives \( 47.5 \) (not a perfect square).  Finally, for \( n = 67 \): - The numbers are 67, 69, 71, 73, 75. - The sum is \( 67 + 69 + 71 + 73 + 75 = 355 \). - Dividing by 10 gives \( 35.5 \) (not a perfect square).  After checking all options, we find that none of the numbers yield a perfect square when the sum is divided by 10. However, since the question asks for which of the numbers can be one of these 5 numbers, we can conclude that:  The only number that fits the criteria of being a two-digit odd number is:  # 41",,41.0

We can express the total number of students interested in at least one game as: \[ \text{Total interested} = \text{Football} + \text{Cricket} + \text{Basketball} \] Substituting the expressions we have: \[ \text{Total interested} = 0.08x + \frac{4}{5}x + 0.10x \]  Now, we need to convert \( \frac{4}{5}x \) into a decimal for easier calculation: \[ \frac{4}{5} = 0.80 \] Thus, we can rewrite the equation as: \[ \text{Total interested} = 0.08x + 0.80x + 0.10x = (0.08 + 0.80 + 0.10)x = 0.98x \]  The number of students not interested in any games is given as 20. Therefore, we can set up the equation: \[ x - \text{Total interested} = 20 \] Substituting the expression for Total interested: \[ x - 0.98x = 20 \] This simplifies to: \[ 0.02x = 20 \]  Now, we can solve for \( x \): \[ x = \frac{20}{0.02} = 1000 \]  Thus, the total number of students in the class is:  # 1000",,1000.0

Since \( r + t = 50 \) and \( t = 50 - r \), we can see that \( r \) can take any value from 0 to 50, which means \( r - q \) can also vary.

Given that his current batting average is 51, we can express the total runs scored before the finals as:  \[ \text{Total Runs Scored} = 51n \]  In the finals, Sachin scores 78 runs. After this match, his new batting average becomes 54. Therefore, the total runs scored after the finals can be expressed as:  \[ \text{Total Runs Scored after finals} = 51n + 78 \]  The total number of matches played after the finals is \( n + 1 \). Thus, we can set up the equation for the new batting average:  \[ 54 = \frac{51n + 78}{n + 1} \]  Now, we will cross-multiply to eliminate the fraction:  \[ 54(n + 1) = 51n + 78 \]  Expanding both sides gives:  \[ 54n + 54 = 51n + 78 \]  Now, we will isolate \( n \):  \[ 54n - 51n = 78 - 54 \]  This simplifies to:  \[ 3n = 24 \]  Dividing both sides by 3 gives:  \[ n = 8 \]  Thus, the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season is:  \[ n + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 \]  Therefore, the final answer is:  # 9",,9.0

According to the problem, the length \( l \) can be expressed in terms of the breadth as follows:  \[ l = 4b + 1 \]  The area \( A \) of the rectangle is given by the formula:  \[ A = l \times b \]  We know the area is 150 sq m, so we can set up the equation:  \[ (4b + 1) \times b = 150 \]  Expanding this equation gives:  \[ 4b^2 + b = 150 \]  Rearranging it into standard quadratic form results in:  \[ 4b^2 + b - 150 = 0 \]  Next, we will use the quadratic formula to solve for \( b \):  \[ b = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} \]  Here, \( A = 4 \), \( B = 1 \), and \( C = -150 \). Plugging in these values:  \[ b = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot (-150)}}{2 \cdot 4} \] \[ b = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 2400}}{8} \] \[ b = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{2401}}{8} \] \[ b = \frac{-1 \pm 49}{8} \]  Calculating the two possible values for \( b \):  1. \( b = \frac{48}{8} = 6 \) 2. \( b = \frac{-50}{8} \) (not valid since breadth cannot be negative)  Thus, the breadth \( b \) is 6 meters. Now we can find the length \( l \):  \[ l = 4b + 1 = 4(6) + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25 \text{ meters} \]  Now, we can calculate the perimeter \( P \) of the rectangle using the formula:  \[ P = 2(l + b) \] \[ P = 2(25 + 6) = 2 \times 31 = 62 \text{ meters} \]  Thus, the perimeter of the rectangular piece is:  # 62 m",,62.0

From the problem, we know that: - Each gram of the health food provides 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E. - Each gram of the health food provides 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.  Thus, if \( x \) grams of the health food are consumed, the total percentage of the minimum daily requirement of each vitamin provided by the health food can be expressed as follows:  For vitamin E: \[ 9\% \times x = 0.09x \]  For vitamin A: \[ 8\% \times x = 0.08x \]  To meet the minimum daily requirement for both vitamins, we need: 1. \( 0.09x \geq 1 \) (for vitamin E) 2. \( 0.08x \geq 1 \) (for vitamin A)  Now, we will solve each inequality separately.  **For vitamin E:** \[ 0.09x \geq 1 \] Dividing both sides by 0.09: \[ x \geq \frac{1}{0.09} \approx 11.11 \]  **For vitamin A:** \[ 0.08x \geq 1 \] Dividing both sides by 0.08: \[ x \geq \frac{1}{0.08} = 12.5 \]  Now, we need to find the larger of the two values obtained from the inequalities, since we need to satisfy both conditions.

['A)6', 'B)7', 'C)8', 'D)9', 'E)10']",6,"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the positions of the points R, S, T, and U on a line based on the given lengths of the segments.  1. **Understanding the segments**:    - We know that \( U \) is the midpoint of segment \( ST \). Therefore, the length of segment \( SU \) is half of the length of segment \( ST \):      \[      SU = \frac{ST}{2} = \frac{22}{2} = 11      \]    - This means that \( U \) is 11 units away from both \( S \) and \( T \).  2. **Positioning the points**:    - Let's place point \( S \) at position 0 on a number line. Then, point \( T \) will be at position 22 (since \( ST = 22 \)).    - Since \( U \) is the midpoint of \( ST \), it will be at:      \[      U = \frac{S + T}{2} = \frac{0 + 22}{2} = 11      \]  3. **Finding the position of point R**:    - We know the length of segment \( RS \) is 5. Since \( S \) is at position 0, point \( R \) can be either at position 5 (to the right of \( S \)) or at position -5 (to the left of \( S \)).    - We also know the length of segment \( RT \) is 17. If \( R \) is at position 5, then the position of \( T \) (which is at 22) gives:      \[      RT = |R - T| = |5 - 22| = 17      \]    - This confirms that \( R \) is at position 5.  4. **Calculating the length of segment \( RU \)**:    - Now, we can find the length of segment \( RU \):      \[      RU = |R - U| = |5 - 11| = 6      \]  Thus, the length of segment \( RU \) is 6.

"Boomtown urban planners expect the city’s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? ['A)20%', 'B)40%', 'C)50%', 'D)65%', 'E)75%']",65%,"Let the population of Boomtown one year ago be denoted as \( P \).  According to the problem, the population is expected to increase by 10% per year for the next two years. Therefore, the population after one year will be:  \[ P_1 = P \times (1 + 0.10) = P \times 1.10 \]  After another year, the population will be:  \[ P_2 = P_1 \times (1 + 0.10) = (P \times 1.10) \times 1.10 = P \times (1.10)^2 = P \times 1.21 \]  We are told that the population two years from now will be exactly double the population of one year ago. Thus, we can set up the equation:  \[ P \times 1.21 = 2P \]  To solve for \( P \), we can divide both sides by \( P \) (assuming \( P \neq 0 \)):  \[ 1.21 = 2 \]  This equation is not valid, indicating that we need to find the percent increase over the last year based on the information given.  To find the percent increase over the last year, we need to determine the population one year ago and the population now. We know that the population now is \( P_1 = P \times 1.10 \).  The percent increase from one year ago to now is given by:  \[ \text{Percent Increase} = \frac{\text{Current Population} - \text{Population One Year Ago}}{\text{Population One Year Ago}} \times 100\% \]  Substituting the values we have:  \[ \text{Percent Increase} = \frac{(P \times 1.10) - P}{P} \times 100\% \]  This simplifies to:  \[ \text{Percent Increase} = \frac{P \times 1.10 - P}{P} \times 100\% = \frac{0.10P}{P} \times 100\% = 10\% \]  However, we need to find the percent increase over the last year that would lead to the population doubling in two years.   Since we established that \( P \times 1.21 = 2P \), we can find the population one year ago in terms of the population now:  \[ P = \frac{P \times 1.21}{2} \]  This means the population one year ago is half of the population two years from now.   Now, we can calculate the percent increase from one year ago to now:  Let \( P_0 \) be the population one year ago, then:  \[ P_0 = P \] \[ P_1 = P \times 1.10 \]  The percent increase from \( P_0 \) to \( P_1 \) is:  \[ \text{Percent Increase} = \frac{P_1 - P_0}{P_0} \times 100\% = \frac{(P \times 1.10) - P}{P} \times 100\% = \frac{0.10P}{P} \times 100\% = 10\% \]  This is incorrect as we need to find the percent increase that leads to the population doubling in two years.  Let’s denote the population one year ago as \( P_0 \). The population now is \( P_1 = P_0 \times (1 + r) \), where \( r \) is the percent increase we are trying to find.  After two years, the population will be:  \[ P_2 = P_1 \times 1.21 = P_0 \times (1 + r) \times 1.21 \]  Setting this equal to \( 2P_0 \):  \[ P_0 \times (1 + r) \times 1.21 = 2P_0 \]  Dividing both sides by \( P_0 \):  \[ (1 + r) \times 1.21 = 2 \]  Solving for \( r \):  \[ 1 + r = \frac{2}{1.21} \] \[ r = \frac{2}{1.21} - 1 \] \[ r = \frac{2 - 1.21}{1.21} = \frac{0.79}{1.21} \approx 0.652 \]  Converting \( r \) to a percentage:  \[ r \approx 0.652 \times 100\% \approx 65.2\% \]  Thus, the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year is closest to:  # 65%",,65.0

When one edge of the square is trimmed by 4 feet, the dimensions of the resulting rectangle become \( s \) feet by \( s - 4 \) feet.  The area \( A \) of the rectangle can be calculated as follows:  \[ A = s \times (s - 4) = s^2 - 4s \]  This rectangle is then cut diagonally into two triangles. The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet. Therefore, the area of the rectangle can also be expressed as:  \[ \text{Area of rectangle} = 2 \times \text{Area of one triangle} = 2 \times 70 = 140 \text{ square feet} \]  Setting the two expressions for the area of the rectangle equal gives:  \[ s^2 - 4s = 140 \]  Rearranging this equation leads to:  \[ s^2 - 4s - 140 = 0 \]  Now, we can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:  \[ s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]  Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -140 \).

"A book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%. If it were sold for Rs. 25.75, then would have been percentage of profit and loss ? ['A)2% Profit', 'B)3% Profit', 'C)2% Loss', 'D)3% Loss', 'E)4% Loss']",3% Profit,"To find the cost price (CP) of the book, we start with the selling price (SP) and the profit percentage.  Given: - Selling Price (SP) = Rs 27.50 - Profit Percentage = 10%  The formula for selling price when profit is involved is: \[ SP = CP + (Profit \% \times CP) \] This can be rewritten as: \[ SP = CP \times (1 + \frac{Profit \%}{100}) \]  Substituting the known values: \[ 27.50 = CP \times (1 + \frac{10}{100}) \] \[ 27.50 = CP \times 1.10 \]  Now, we can solve for CP: \[ CP = \frac{27.50}{1.10} \] \[ CP = 25.00 \]  Now that we have the cost price, we can find the profit or loss when the book is sold for Rs 25.75.  New Selling Price (SP) = Rs 25.75  Next, we calculate the difference between the new selling price and the cost price: \[ \text{Difference} = SP - CP = 25.75 - 25.00 = 0.75 \]  Since the selling price (Rs 25.75) is greater than the cost price (Rs 25.00), we have a profit.   Now, we calculate the percentage of profit: \[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Profit}}{CP} \right) \times 100 \] \[ \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{0.75}{25.00} \right) \times 100 \] \[ \text{Profit Percentage} = 3\% \]  Thus, if the book were sold for Rs 25.75, the percentage of profit would be 3%.  The final answer is: # 3% Profit",,3.0
"In how many ways can a teacher in a kindergarten school arrange a group of 3 children (Susan, Tim and Zen) on 3 identical chairs in a straight line so that Susan is on the left of Tim? ['A)7', 'B)3', 'C)2', 'D)1', 'E)6']",3,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to arrange the three children (Susan, Tim, and Zen) on three identical chairs in a straight line, with the condition that Susan must be positioned to the left of Tim.  1. **Total Arrangements Without Restrictions**:     First, we calculate the total number of arrangements of the three children without any restrictions. Since there are 3 children, the total arrangements can be calculated using the factorial of the number of children:    \[    3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6    \]     The possible arrangements are:    - Susan, Tim, Zen (STZ)    - Susan, Zen, Tim (SZT)    - Tim, Susan, Zen (TSZ)    - Tim, Zen, Susan (TZS)    - Zen, Susan, Tim (ZST)    - Zen, Tim, Susan (ZTS)  2. **Applying the Condition (Susan Left of Tim)**:    Out of the 6 arrangements, we need to count only those where Susan is to the left of Tim.      The arrangements where Susan is to the left of Tim are:    - Susan, Tim, Zen (STZ)    - Susan, Zen, Tim (SZT)    - Zen, Susan, Tim (ZST)     The arrangements where Tim is to the left of Susan are:    - Tim, Susan, Zen (TSZ)    - Tim, Zen, Susan (TZS)    - Zen, Tim, Susan (ZTS)     Since the arrangements are symmetric, exactly half of the arrangements will have Susan to the left of Tim. Therefore, we can conclude:    \[    \text{Number of arrangements with Susan left of Tim} = \frac{6}{2} = 3    \]  Thus, the final answer is:  # 3",,3.0
"The telephone bill of a certain establishment is party fixed and partly varies as the number of calls consumed. When in a certain month 540 calls made the bill is Rs.1800. In another month 620 calls are consumed then the bill becomes Rs.2040. In another month 500 units are consumed due to more
holidays. The bill for that month would be : ['A)Rs.1560', 'B)Rs.1680', 'C)Rs.1840', 'D)Rs.1950', 'E)Rs.1690']",Rs.1680,"Let the fixed part of the telephone bill be \( F \) and the variable part per call be \( V \).

For 620 calls:    \[    F + 620V = 2040 \quad \text{(2)}    \]  Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously. First, we can subtract equation (1) from equation (2):  \[ (F + 620V) - (F + 540V) = 2040 - 1800 \] \[ 620V - 540V = 240 \] \[ 80V = 240 \] \[ V = \frac{240}{80} = 3 \]  Now that we have \( V = 3 \), we can substitute this value back into equation (1) to find \( F \):  \[ F + 540 \times 3 = 1800 \] \[ F + 1620 = 1800 \] \[ F = 1800 - 1620 = 180 \]  Now we have both \( F \) and \( V \): - Fixed part \( F = 180 \) - Variable part \( V = 3 \)  Next, we need to calculate the bill for the month when 500 calls are made:  \[ \text{Bill} = F + 500V \] \[ \text{Bill} = 180 + 500 \times 3 \] \[ \text{Bill} = 180 + 1500 = 1680 \]  Thus, the bill for that month would be:  # 1680",,1680.0

"A bookshelf contains 45 books, 30 of which are hardcover and 20 of which are fiction. What is the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction? ['A)10', 'B)15', 'C)18', 'D)20', 'E)30']",20,"To find the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.  Let: - \( H \) be the number of hardcover books = 30 - \( F \) be the number of fiction books = 20 - \( B \) be the total number of books = 45  We want to find the maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction, denoted as \( x \).  According to the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the total number of books can be expressed as:  \[ B = H + F - x \]  Substituting the known values into the equation:  \[ 45 = 30 + 20 - x \]  This simplifies to:  \[ 45 = 50 - x \]  Rearranging gives:  \[ x = 50 - 45 = 5 \]  This means that at least 5 books are both hardcover and fiction. However, we need to find the maximum possible value of \( x \).  To maximize \( x \), we need to consider the constraints: - The number of hardcover books cannot exceed 30. - The number of fiction books cannot exceed 20.  The maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction is limited by the smaller of the two groups, which is the number of fiction books. Therefore, the maximum possible value of \( x \) is:  \[ x \leq \min(H, F) = \min(30, 20) = 20 \]  However, we also need to ensure that the total number of books does not exceed 45. If we assume \( x = 20 \):  \[ B = H + F - x = 30 + 20 - 20 = 30 \]  This is valid since 30 is less than 45. Thus, the maximum number of books that can be both hardcover and fiction is indeed 20.

['A)15', 'B)30', 'C)45', 'D)60', 'E)75']",15,"Let \( x \) be the number of newspapers the hotel buys on each of the days from Monday to Saturday. Since the hotel orders twice as many newspapers on Sunday, it buys \( 2x \) newspapers on that day.  The cost of newspapers for the week can be calculated as follows:  - Cost for Sunday: \( 2x \) newspapers at $4 each, which totals \( 2x \times 4 = 8x \). - Cost for Monday to Saturday: \( x \) newspapers each day for 6 days at $1 each, which totals \( 6x \times 1 = 6x \).  Now, we can set up the equation for the total cost for the week:  \[ 8x + 6x = 210 \]  Combining the terms gives:  \[ 14x = 210 \]  To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 14:  \[ x = \frac{210}{14} = 15 \]  Now, since \( x \) represents the number of newspapers bought from Monday to Saturday, the hotel buys \( 15 \) newspapers on Monday.

The total cost for the eatables is Rs. 96. Therefore, the contribution per person if all \( x \) friends had attended would be:  \[ \text{Contribution per person} = \frac{96}{x} \]  However, since 4 friends did not turn up, the number of friends who actually attended the picnic is \( x - 4 \). The contribution per person for those who attended is:  \[ \text{Contribution per person} = \frac{96}{x - 4} \]  According to the problem, the contribution per person for those who attended is Rs. 4 more than what it would have been if all had attended. Therefore, we can set up the equation:  \[ \frac{96}{x - 4} = \frac{96}{x} + 4 \]  To eliminate the fractions, we can multiply through by \( x(x - 4) \):  \[ 96x = 96(x - 4) + 4x(x - 4) \]  Expanding both sides:  \[ 96x = 96x - 384 + 4x^2 - 16x \]  Now, simplifying the equation:  \[ 0 = -384 + 4x^2 - 16x \]  Rearranging gives:  \[ 4x^2 - 16x + 384 = 0 \]  Dividing the entire equation by 4 simplifies it:  \[ x^2 - 4x + 96 = 0 \]  Next, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for \( x \):  \[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]  Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = 96 \):  \[ x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 96}}{2 \cdot 1} \] \[ x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 - 384}}{2} \] \[ x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{-368}}{2} \]  Since the discriminant is negative, it indicates that there is no real solution for \( x \) in this context.

If John gives Mark half of his money, then Mark will have Rs. 75:    \[    M + \frac{J}{2} = 75    \]    Rearranging gives:    \[    M = 75 - \frac{J}{2} \quad \text{(Equation 1)}    \]  From John's statement, we can set up another equation: 2. If Mark gives John one third of his money, then John will have Rs. 75:    \[    J + \frac{M}{3} = 75    \]    Rearranging gives:    \[    J = 75 - \frac{M}{3} \quad \text{(Equation 2)}    \]  Now we have two equations: 1. \( M = 75 - \frac{J}{2} \) 2. \( J = 75 - \frac{M}{3} \)  We can substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2. First, we express \( M \) in terms of \( J \): \[ M = 75 - \frac{J}{2} \]  Now substitute this into Equation 2: \[ J = 75 - \frac{75 - \frac{J}{2}}{3} \]  Simplifying the right side: \[ J = 75 - \frac{75}{3} + \frac{J}{6} \] \[ J = 75 - 25 + \frac{J}{6} \] \[ J = 50 + \frac{J}{6} \]  To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 6: \[ 6J = 300 + J \] \[ 6J - J = 300 \] \[ 5J = 300 \] \[ J = 60 \]  Thus, the amount of money John had is Rs. 60.

"The number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it? ['A)15', 'B)28', 'C)30', 'D)53', 'E)59']",53,"To solve the problem, we first need to understand the growth pattern of the water lilies. The number of water lilies doubles every two days.   Given that it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies starting from 1 water lily, we can deduce the following:  1. At day 60, the lake is fully covered. 2. At day 58 (2 days before), the lake would have been half-covered, since the number of lilies doubles every two days.   Continuing this reasoning backwards: - Day 56: One quarter of the lake is covered. - Day 54: One eighth of the lake is covered. - Day 52: One sixteenth of the lake is covered. - Day 50: One thirty-second of the lake is covered. - Day 48: One sixty-fourth of the lake is covered.  Now, if we start with 64 water lilies instead of 1, we need to determine how many days it will take to cover the lake.  Since 64 water lilies is equivalent to \(2^6\) (as \(64 = 2^6\)), we can see that starting with 64 water lilies means we are starting at the point where the lake is already \(1/64\) covered (since it takes 60 days to go from 1 to full coverage).  From the previous deductions: - At day 48, the lake is \(1/64\) covered. - At day 50, the lake is \(1/32\) covered. - At day 52, the lake is \(1/16\) covered. - At day 54, the lake is \(1/8\) covered. - At day 56, the lake is \(1/4\) covered. - At day 58, the lake is \(1/2\) covered. - At day 60, the lake is fully covered.  Since we start with 64 water lilies, which is \(1/64\) of the lake covered, we only need 2 days to reach full coverage from that point (from \(1/64\) to \(1/32\) in 2 days, and then to full coverage in another 2 days).  Thus, starting from day 48 (when the lake is \(1/64\) covered), it will take 2 days to reach \(1/32\) and another 2 days to reach full coverage.  Therefore, the total time taken from the initial state of 64 water lilies to full coverage is:  - 48 days (when it is \(1/64\) covered) + 4 days = 52 days.  Thus, the lake will be fully covered with lilies in 52 days.  # 52",,52.0

"ABCDE is a regular pentagon with F at its center. How many different quadrilaterals can be formed by joining 4 of the points A,B,C,D,E and F? ['A)12', 'B)10', 'C)5', 'D)15', 'E)20']",15,"To determine how many different quadrilaterals can be formed by joining 4 of the points A, B, C, D, E, and F, we first note that there are 6 points in total: the vertices of the pentagon (A, B, C, D, E) and the center point (F).  We need to select 4 points from these 6 points. The number of ways to choose 4 points from 6 can be calculated using the binomial coefficient:  \[ \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \]  where \( n \) is the total number of points (6 in this case) and \( k \) is the number of points to choose (4).  Calculating \( \binom{6}{4} \):  \[ \binom{6}{4} = \frac{6!}{4!(6-4)!} = \frac{6!}{4! \cdot 2!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15 \]  Next, we need to ensure that the selected points can indeed form a quadrilateral. A quadrilateral can be formed as long as not all selected points are collinear.   1. If we select 4 points from the 5 vertices (A, B, C, D, E), they will always form a quadrilateral since no 4 vertices of a regular pentagon are collinear. 2. If we select 3 vertices and the center F, they will also form a quadrilateral since the center point F is not collinear with any combination of 3 vertices. 3. If we select 2 vertices and the center F, we can choose any 2 vertices from the 5, and they will form a triangle with F, which is not a quadrilateral. 4. If we select 1 vertex and the center F, we cannot form a quadrilateral.  Thus, the only combinations that do not yield a quadrilateral are those that include only the center F and fewer than 3 vertices.   Since we have already calculated that there are 15 ways to choose 4 points from 6, and all of these combinations will yield valid quadrilaterals, we conclude that the total number of different quadrilaterals that can be formed is:  # 15",,15.0

The total measure of a circle is 360°.     We can express minor arc AD as:    \[    \text{Arc AD} = \text{Arc AB} + \text{Arc BD} + \text{Arc DA}    \]    However, we need to find Arc DA. Since D lies on the circle and we know the measure of arc BD, we can find Arc DA by subtracting the measures of the arcs we know from the total circle.     First, we find the measure of arc AC:    \[    \text{Arc AC} = \text{Arc AB} + \text{Arc BC} = 80° + 80° = 160°.    \]     Now, we can find the remaining arc:    \[    \text{Arc AD} = 360° - \text{Arc AC} - \text{Arc BD} = 360° - 160° - 150° = 50°.    \]     However, we need to find the measure of minor arc AD directly. Since we have already established that:    \[    \text{Arc AD} = \text{Arc AB} + \text{Arc BD} = 80° + 150° = 230°.    \]    But this is not correct since we are looking for minor arc AD, which is the arc from A to D directly.     To find minor arc AD, we can also consider:    \[    \text{Arc AD} = 360° - \text{Arc DB} = 360° - 150° = 210°.    \]     Since we are looking for the minor arc, we need to find the smaller angle between A and D.      The correct calculation should be:    \[    \text{Arc AD} = 360° - (80° + 150°) = 360° - 230° = 130°.    \]  Thus, the measure of minor arc AD is:  # 130°",,130.0

Next, we need to find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation, which is represented by \( |S \cap W^c| \).  Using the relationship: \[ |S| = |S \cap W| + |S \cap W^c| \] We can substitute the known values: \[ 45\% = 40\% + |S \cap W^c| \] Solving for \( |S \cap W^c| \): \[ |S \cap W^c| = 45\% - 40\% = 5\% \]  Thus, the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is 5%.

Thus, the numerator becomes approximately:  \[ 5184 + 1287.168 + 16 \approx 6490.168 \]  Calculating \( 24\sqrt{2} \approx 24 \cdot 1.414 \approx 33.936 \):  Thus, the denominator becomes approximately:  \[ 76 + 33.936 \approx 109.936 \]  Now, substituting into \( x \):  \[ x \approx \frac{6490.168}{109.936} \approx 59 \]  ### Conclusion  From our calculations, we have:  - At \( n = 36 \), \( x = 28 \). - At \( n = 72 \), \( x \approx 59 \).  Thus, \( x \) ranges from 28 to approximately 59. Therefore, the correct option is:  # D) 28 < x < 60  Final answer:  # 28 < x < 60",,60.0

"A starts a business with Rs.40,000. After 2 months, B joined him with Rs.60,000. C joined them after some more time with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. How many months after B joined the business, did C join? ['A)2 months', 'B)4 months', 'C)23 months', 'D)24 months', 'E)84 months']",4 months,"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many months after B joined the business that C joined, based on the profit-sharing arrangement.  1. **Initial Investments and Time Contributions**:    - A invests Rs. 40,000 and works for 12 months.    - B invests Rs. 60,000 and joins after 2 months, so he works for 10 months.    - C invests Rs. 120,000 and joins after some time, which we need to find out. Let’s denote the number of months after B joined that C joins as \( x \). Therefore, C works for \( 10 - x \) months.  2. **Calculating the Capital Contribution**:    The profit share is based on the product of the amount invested and the time for which it is invested. We calculate the capital contribution for each partner:     - A's contribution:       \[      40,000 \times 12 = 480,000      \]    - B's contribution:       \[      60,000 \times 10 = 600,000      \]    - C's contribution:       \[      120,000 \times (10 - x)      \]  3. **Total Capital Contribution**:    The total capital contribution is:    \[    480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000 \times (10 - x)    \]  4. **Profit Distribution**:    We know that C receives Rs. 150,000 out of a total profit of Rs. 375,000. The ratio of C's share to the total profit is:    \[    \frac{150,000}{375,000} = \frac{2}{5}    \]    This means C's contribution to the total capital must also be in the ratio of \( \frac{2}{5} \).  5. **Setting Up the Equation**:    The total capital contribution can be expressed as:    \[    480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000 \times (10 - x) = 1,080,000 + 120,000 \times (10 - x)    \]    C's share of the total capital contribution is:    \[    120,000 \times (10 - x)    \]    Setting up the equation based on the profit share:    \[    \frac{120,000 \times (10 - x)}{1,080,000 + 120,000 \times (10 - x)} = \frac{2}{5}    \]  6. **Cross-Multiplying**:    Cross-multiplying gives:    \[    5 \times 120,000 \times (10 - x) = 2 \times (1,080,000 + 120,000 \times (10 - x))    \]    Simplifying:    \[    600,000 \times (10 - x) = 2,160,000 + 240,000 \times (10 - x)    \]    Rearranging:    \[    600,000 \times (10 - x) - 240,000 \times (10 - x) = 2,160,000    \]    \[    360,000 \times (10 - x) = 2,160,000    \]    Dividing both sides by 360,000:    \[    10 - x = 6    \]    Thus:    \[    x = 4    \]  Therefore, C joined the business 4 months after B joined.

Therefore, the radius \( r \) is:    \[    r = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ cm}    \]    Now, substituting the radius into the area formula:    \[    A_{\text{semi-circle}} = \frac{1}{2} \pi (10)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (100) = 50\pi \text{ cm}^2    \]  3. **Calculate the area of two semi-circles**:    Since there are two semi-circles, the total area \( A_{\text{two semi-circles}} \) is:    \[    A_{\text{two semi-circles}} = 2 \times A_{\text{semi-circle}} = 2 \times 50\pi = 100\pi \text{ cm}^2    \]  4. **Calculate the area of the remaining paper**:    The area of the remaining paper \( A_{\text{remaining}} \) is the area of the square minus the area of the two semi-circles:    \[    A_{\text{remaining}} = A_{\text{square}} - A_{\text{two semi-circles}} = 400 - 100\pi    \]  5. **Substituting the value of \( \pi \)**:    Using \( \pi \approx 3.14 \):    \[    A_{\text{remaining}} = 400 - 100 \times 3.14 = 400 - 314 = 86 \text{ cm}^2    \]  6. **Final calculation**:    The area of the remaining paper is:    \[    A_{\text{remaining}} \approx 86 \text{ cm}^2    \]  However, the options provided seem to suggest a different interpretation. Let's check the calculations again for any possible misunderstanding.  The area of the remaining paper after cutting out the two semi-circles is indeed: \[ A_{\text{remaining}} = 400 - 100\pi \approx 400 - 314.16 \approx 85.84 \text{ cm}^2 \]  Since the options provided are in the range of 8.7, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the area.   If we divide the area by 10 to match the options: \[ \frac{A_{\text{remaining}}}{10} \approx \frac{85.84}{10} \approx 8.584 \]  This value does not match any of the options directly.   Thus, the area of the remaining paper is approximately: \[ A_{\text{remaining}} \approx 85.84 \text{ cm}^2 \]  Final numerical answer: # 85.84",,85.84

This can be expressed as:  \[ \frac{64 + x}{40 + x} = \frac{4}{3} \]  To eliminate the fraction, we can cross-multiply:  \[ 3(64 + x) = 4(40 + x) \]  Expanding both sides gives:  \[ 192 + 3x = 160 + 4x \]  Now, we can rearrange the equation to isolate \( x \):  \[ 192 - 160 = 4x - 3x \]  This simplifies to:  \[ 32 = x \]  Now that we have found \( x \), we can calculate the new number of boys and girls:  - New number of boys = \( 64 + 32 = 96 \) - New number of girls = \( 40 + 32 = 72 \)  Now, we can find the total number of members in the group:  \[ \text{Total members} = \text{New number of boys} + \text{New number of girls} = 96 + 72 = 168 \]  Thus, the total number of members in the group now is:  # 168",,168.0
"A cyclist travels at 12 miles per hour. How many minutes will it take to travel 48 miles? ['A)1', 'B)240', 'C)30', 'D)60', 'E)120']",240,"To determine how long it will take the cyclist to travel 48 miles at a speed of 12 miles per hour, we can use the formula:  \[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]  In this case, the distance is 48 miles and the speed is 12 miles per hour.

If we subtract 495 from the number, we get the number with its digits reversed:    \[    100x + 10y + z - 495 = 100z + 10y + x    \]     Rearranging this gives:    \[    100x + 10y + z - 100z - 10y - x = 495    \]    Simplifying further:    \[    99x - 99z = 495    \]    Dividing through by 99:    \[    x - z = 5 \quad \text{(1)}    \]  From equation (1), we can express \( x \) in terms of \( z \): \[ x = z + 5 \]  Now, substituting \( x = z + 5 \) into the first equation \( x + y + z = 17 \): \[ (z + 5) + y + z = 17 \] This simplifies to: \[ 2z + y + 5 = 17 \] \[ 2z + y = 12 \quad \text{(2)} \]  Next, we substitute \( x = z + 5 \) into the second equation \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 109 \): \[ (z + 5)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 109 \] Expanding \( (z + 5)^2 \): \[ z^2 + 10z + 25 + y^2 + z^2 = 109 \] Combining like terms: \[ 2z^2 + 10z + y^2 + 25 = 109 \] Subtracting 25 from both sides: \[ 2z^2 + 10z + y^2 = 84 \quad \text{(3)} \]  Now we have two equations (2) and (3): 1. \( 2z + y = 12 \) 2. \( 2z^2 + 10z + y^2 = 84 \)  From equation (2), we can express \( y \) in terms of \( z \): \[ y = 12 - 2z \]  Substituting \( y = 12 - 2z \) into equation (3): \[ 2z^2 + 10z + (12 - 2z)^2 = 84 \] Expanding \( (12 - 2z)^2 \): \[ 2z^2 + 10z + (144 - 48z + 4z^2) = 84 \] Combining like terms: \[ 6z^2 - 38z + 144 = 84 \] Subtracting 84 from both sides: \[ 6z^2 - 38z + 60 = 0 \] Dividing the entire equation by 2: \[ 3z^2 - 19z + 30 = 0 \]  Now we can use the quadratic formula to solve for \( z \): \[ z = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \frac{19 \pm \sqrt{(-19)^2 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 30}}{2 \cdot 3} \] Calculating the discriminant: \[ 19^2 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 30 = 361 - 360 = 1 \] Thus: \[ z = \frac{19 \pm 1}{6} \] Calculating the two possible values for \( z \): 1. \( z = \frac{20}{6} = \frac{10}{3} \) (not an integer) 2. \( z = \frac{18}{6} = 3 \)  So, \( z = 3 \). Now substituting back to find \( x \) and \( y \): \[ x = z + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \] \[ y = 12 - 2z = 12 - 2 \cdot 3 = 6 \]  Thus, the digits of the number are \( x = 8 \), \( y = 6 \), \( z = 3 \), giving us the number \( 863 \).  Finally, we check if \( 863 - 495 = 368 \) which is indeed \( 368 \) (the reverse of \( 863 \)).  Therefore, the three-digit number is:  # 863",,863.0

Now, for 40 grams of alloy X: - Amount of zinc in alloy X:   \[   \text{Zinc in X} = 40 \times \frac{2}{5} = 16 \text{ grams}   \] - Amount of copper in alloy X:   \[   \text{Copper in X} = 40 \times \frac{3}{5} = 24 \text{ grams}   \]  **Step 2: Analyze Alloy Y** - The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Y is 7:11. - The total parts in alloy Y is \(7 + 11 = 18\). - Therefore, the fraction of zinc in alloy Y is \( \frac{7}{18} \) and the fraction of copper is \( \frac{11}{18} \).  Now, for 60 grams of alloy Y: - Amount of zinc in alloy Y:   \[   \text{Zinc in Y} = 60 \times \frac{7}{18} = \frac{420}{18} = 23.33 \text{ grams} \quad (\text{approximately } 23.33)   \] - Amount of copper in alloy Y:   \[   \text{Copper in Y} = 60 \times \frac{11}{18} = \frac{660}{18} = 36.67 \text{ grams} \quad (\text{approximately } 36.67)   \]  **Step 3: Combine Alloys X and Y to form Alloy Z** - Total amount of zinc in alloy Z:   \[   \text{Total Zinc} = \text{Zinc in X} + \text{Zinc in Y} = 16 + 23.33 = 39.33 \text{ grams}   \] - Total amount of copper in alloy Z:   \[   \text{Total Copper} = \text{Copper in X} + \text{Copper in Y} = 24 + 36.67 = 60.67 \text{ grams}   \]  **Step 4: Calculate the Ratio of Zinc to Copper in Alloy Z** - The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is:   \[   \text{Ratio} = \frac{39.33}{60.67}   \]  To express this ratio in whole numbers, we can multiply both the numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate the decimals: \[ \text{Ratio} = \frac{3933}{6067} \]  Now, we can simplify this ratio. We can use a calculator or perform the division: - Dividing both by their greatest common divisor (GCD) gives us approximately: \[ \text{Ratio} \approx 59:91 \]  Thus, the final ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is:  # 59:91",,91.0

"Everyone in the family earns money each month. If the total income of a family per month is $9000 and the median income is $3000, how many members are there in the family? ['A)2', 'B)3', 'C)4', 'D)5', 'E)6']",3,"To determine the number of members in the family based on the total income and the median income, we need to understand the implications of the median in relation to the total income.  1. **Understanding Median**: The median income is the middle value when all incomes are arranged in ascending order. If there is an odd number of family members, the median is the middle income. If there is an even number of family members, the median is the average of the two middle incomes.  2. **Given Information**:    - Total income = $9000    - Median income = $3000  3. **Analyzing Possible Family Sizes**:    - **If there are 2 members**: The median would be the average of the two incomes. For the median to be $3000, both incomes would need to be $3000. This gives a total income of $6000, which does not match the given total of $9000. So, 2 members is not possible.        - **If there are 3 members**: The median would be the second income when arranged in order. For the median to be $3000, the incomes could be something like $x, $3000, and $y, where $x ≤ $3000 ≤ $y. The total income would be $x + 3000 + y = 9000, which simplifies to $x + y = 6000. This is possible, so 3 members could work.     - **If there are 4 members**: The median would be the average of the two middle incomes. For the median to be $3000, the two middle incomes would need to average to $3000. This means they could be $a$ and $b$ such that $(a + b)/2 = 3000$, or $a + b = 6000$. The total income would then be $a + b + c + d = 9000$, which simplifies to $c + d = 3000$. This is also possible, so 4 members could work.     - **If there are 5 members**: The median would be the third income when arranged in order. For the median to be $3000, the incomes could be $x, y, 3000, z, w$, where $x ≤ y ≤ 3000 ≤ z ≤ w. The total income would be $x + y + 3000 + z + w = 9000$, which simplifies to $x + y + z + w = 6000$. This is also possible, so 5 members could work.     - **If there are 6 members**: The median would be the average of the third and fourth incomes. For the median to be $3000, the two middle incomes would need to average to $3000. This means they could be $c$ and $d$ such that $(c + d)/2 = 3000$, or $c + d = 6000$. The total income would then be $a + b + c + d + e + f = 9000$, which simplifies to $a + b + e + f = 3000$. This is also possible, so 6 members could work.  4. **Conclusion**: The possible family sizes that satisfy both the total income and the median income are 3, 4, 5, and 6 members. However, since the question asks for the number of members and provides options, we need to select the smallest number that fits the criteria.  The smallest number of family members that can achieve a median of $3000 with a total income of $9000 is 3.  Thus, the final answer is:  # 3",,3.0

The earnings from the copper coins are \( 0.20c \) dollars, and the earnings from the brass coins are \( 0.25b \) dollars. The total earnings from both types of coins is given as:  \[ 0.20c + 0.25b = 3.40 \]  To eliminate the decimals, we can multiply the entire equation by 100:  \[ 20c + 25b = 340 \]  Next, we can simplify this equation by dividing everything by 5:  \[ 4c + 5b = 68 \]  Now, we need to express \( b \) in terms of \( c \):  \[ 5b = 68 - 4c \] \[ b = \frac{68 - 4c}{5} \]  For \( b \) to be a non-negative integer, \( 68 - 4c \) must be non-negative and divisible by 5. Thus, we have:  1. \( 68 - 4c \geq 0 \) 2. \( 68 - 4c \equiv 0 \mod 5 \)  From the first inequality:  \[ 68 \geq 4c \implies c \leq 17 \]  Now, we check the second condition. We can simplify \( 68 \mod 5 \):  \[ 68 \div 5 = 13 \quad \text{(remainder 3)} \] \[ 68 \equiv 3 \mod 5 \]  Thus, we need:  \[ 68 - 4c \equiv 0 \mod 5 \implies 3 - 4c \equiv 0 \mod 5 \implies 4c \equiv 3 \mod 5 \]  To solve \( 4c \equiv 3 \mod 5 \), we can find the multiplicative inverse of 4 modulo 5. The inverse is 4, since:  \[ 4 \times 4 \equiv 1 \mod 5 \]  Multiplying both sides of \( 4c \equiv 3 \) by 4 gives:  \[ 16c \equiv 12 \mod 5 \implies c \equiv 2 \mod 5 \]  Thus, \( c \) can take values of the form:  \[ c = 5k + 2 \quad \text{for integers } k \]  Now, we also have the constraint \( c \leq 17 \). Let's find the possible values of \( c \):  - For \( k = 0 \): \( c = 2 \) - For \( k = 1 \): \( c = 7 \) - For \( k = 2 \): \( c = 12 \) - For \( k = 3 \): \( c = 17 \)  Now we will check each of these values to find the corresponding \( b \):  1. **If \( c = 2 \)**:    \[    4(2) + 5b = 68 \implies 8 + 5b = 68 \implies 5b = 60 \implies b = 12    \]  2. **If \( c = 7 \)**:    \[    4(7) + 5b = 68 \implies 28 + 5b = 68 \implies 5b = 40 \implies b = 8    \]  3. **If \( c = 12 \)**:    \[    4(12) + 5b = 68 \implies 48 + 5b = 68 \implies 5b = 20 \implies b = 4    \]  4. **If \( c = 17 \)**:    \[    4(17) + 5b = 68 \implies 68 + 5b = 68 \implies 5b = 0 \implies b = 0    \]  Now we have the following pairs \((c, b)\): - \( (2, 12) \) - \( (7, 8) \) - \( (12, 4) \) - \( (17, 0) \)  The minimum number of copper coins \( c \) that she could have brought is \( 2 \).

The store sold 80% of its inventory, which means it sold:    \[    0.8 \times 600 = 480 \text{ golf balls}    \]  3. The store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and it sold all of its white golf balls. Let \( x \) be the number of white golf balls sold. Since all white golf balls were sold, we have:    \[    x = w    \]  4. The number of yellow golf balls sold is also \( x \), so the total number of golf balls sold can be expressed as:    \[    x + x = 2x    \]    Therefore, we have:    \[    2x = 480    \]    Solving for \( x \):    \[    x = \frac{480}{2} = 240    \]  5.

In this case, the ""containers"" are the colors of the ties, and the ""items"" are the ties themselves.  You have the following colors of ties: - Red: 8 ties - Violet: 13 ties - Blue: 10 ties - Pink: 5 ties - Green: 4 ties  This gives us a total of 5 different colors of ties.

In the first scenario: - Jill bought 10 bottles of soda for 8 people.  We can calculate the number of bottles needed per person: \[ \text{Bottles per person} = \frac{10 \text{ bottles}}{8 \text{ people}} = 1.25 \text{ bottles per person} \]  Now, we can use this ratio to find out how many bottles Jill will need for 12 people: \[ \text{Bottles needed for 12 people} = 1.25 \text{ bottles per person} \times 12 \text{ people} = 15 \text{ bottles} \]  Now, we can check the options provided: - A) 6 - B) 8 - C) 10 - D) 12 - E) 14  None of the options match the calculated requirement of 15 bottles. However, if we consider the closest option, it would be E) 14, but it is still not sufficient.

The height of the ant and the length of its shadow form a proportional relationship.  Let: - \( h_1 = 4 \) inches (height of the first ant) - \( s_1 = 10 \) inches (length of the shadow of the first ant) - \( h_2 = 6 \) inches (height of the second ant) - \( s_2 \) = length of the shadow of the second ant (which we need to find)  Using the property of similar triangles, we can set up the following proportion:  \[ \frac{h_1}{s_1} = \frac{h_2}{s_2} \]  Substituting the known values into the equation:  \[ \frac{4}{10} = \frac{6}{s_2} \]  Cross-multiplying gives:  \[ 4 \cdot s_2 = 6 \cdot 10 \]  Calculating the right side:  \[ 4 \cdot s_2 = 60 \]  Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( s_2 \):  \[ s_2 = \frac{60}{4} = 15 \]  Thus, the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts is 15 inches.  # 15",,15.0

Plugging in these values, we have:  \[ 51 = \frac{k}{2} \times (2(-50) + (k - 1)) \]  This simplifies to:  \[ 51 = \frac{k}{2} \times (-100 + k - 1) \]  \[ 51 = \frac{k}{2} \times (k - 101) \]  Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:  \[ 102 = k(k - 101) \]  Rearranging gives us a quadratic equation:  \[ k^2 - 101k - 102 = 0 \]  Now we can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:  \[ k = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]  Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -101 \), and \( c = -102 \).

This will tell us how many identical bouquets can be made without leaving any flowers out.  1. **Finding the GCD of 28 and 98:**    - First, we can list the factors of each number.    - The factors of 28 are: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28.    - The factors of 98 are: 1, 2, 7, 14, 49, 98.  2. **Identifying the common factors:**    - The common factors of 28 and 98 are: 1, 2, 7, 14.  3. **Finding the greatest common factor:**    - The greatest common factor is 14.  4. **Calculating the number of bouquets:**    - If we can make 14 identical bouquets, we can determine how many tulips of each color will be in each bouquet.    - For white tulips: \( \frac{28}{14} = 2 \) white tulips per bouquet.    - For red tulips: \( \frac{98}{14} = 7 \) red tulips per bouquet.  Since both calculations yield whole numbers, we confirm that it is possible to create 14 identical bouquets.  Thus, the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made is:  # 14",,14.0
"Sharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy an ice cream cake, while Karen works for 4. After how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together? ['A)1 hour', 'B)2 hours', 'C)3 hours', 'D)4 hours', 'E)5 hours']",3 hours,"To solve the problem, we first need to determine how much each person earns per hour based on the information given.  Let’s denote: - Sharon's total earnings for 5 hours as \( S \). - Karen's total earnings for 4 hours as \( K \).  Since both of them earn enough tips to buy the same ice cream cake, we can set up the following equations based on their hourly rates:  1. Sharon's hourly rate:     \[    \text{Sharon's hourly rate} = \frac{S}{5}    \]  2. Karen's hourly rate:     \[    \text{Karen's hourly rate} = \frac{K}{4}    \]  Since both amounts \( S \) and \( K \) are equal (they both can buy the same cake), we can set \( S = K \). Therefore, we can express their hourly rates in terms of the same total amount \( T \) (the cost of the cake):  \[ \frac{T}{5} = \text{Sharon's hourly rate} \] \[ \frac{T}{4} = \text{Karen's hourly rate} \]  Now, we need to find out how much they can earn together in one hour. The combined hourly rate of Sharon and Karen is:  \[ \text{Combined hourly rate} = \frac{T}{5} + \frac{T}{4} \]  To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 5 and 4 is 20. Thus, we can rewrite the rates:  \[ \frac{T}{5} = \frac{4T}{20} \] \[ \frac{T}{4} = \frac{5T}{20} \]  Now, adding these together:  \[ \text{Combined hourly rate} = \frac{4T}{20} + \frac{5T}{20} = \frac{9T}{20} \]  This means that together, Sharon and Karen can earn \( \frac{9T}{20} \) in one hour.  Next, we need to determine how many hours it will take them to earn enough to buy the cake, which costs \( T \). We set up the equation:  \[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Combined hourly rate} \times \text{Time} \] \[ T = \frac{9T}{20} \times t \]  To find \( t \), we can divide both sides by \( T \) (assuming \( T \neq 0 \)):  \[ 1 = \frac{9}{20} \times t \]  Now, solving for \( t \):  \[ t = \frac{20}{9} \]  Calculating \( \frac{20}{9} \) gives approximately 2.22 hours. Since we need to find the number of hours they will need to work together to buy the cake, we can round this to the nearest whole number or choose the closest option provided in the question.  The closest option to \( \frac{20}{9} \) is 2 hours.  Thus, the final answer is:  # 2 hours",,2.0

Therefore, the inequality can be rewritten as:  \[ -x^3 > |y^2| \]  Since \( y > 0 \), we have \( |y^2| = y^2 \). Thus, the inequality becomes:  \[ -x^3 > y^2 \]  This can be rearranged to:  \[ -x^3 - y^2 > 0 \quad \text{or} \quad -x^3 > y^2 \]  Now, let's analyze each option:  **Option A: \( x > y \)**  Since \( x < 0 \) and \( y > 0 \), this cannot be true. Therefore, this option is false.  **Option B: \( y^2 > x^2 \)**  Since \( x < 0 \), we have \( x^2 > 0 \). The inequality \( |x^3| > |y^2| \) implies \( -x^3 > y^2 \). However, we cannot directly conclude that \( y^2 > x^2 \) from the given information. Therefore, this option is not necessarily true.  **Option C: \( -x^3 < y^2 \)**  This contradicts our derived inequality \( -x^3 > y^2 \). Therefore, this option is false.  **Option D: \( -x < y \)**  Since \( x < 0 \), we can write \( -x > 0 \). The inequality \( -x^3 > y^2 \) implies that \( -x^3 \) is a positive number greater than \( y^2 \). However, we cannot directly conclude that \( -x < y \) from the information provided. Therefore, this option is not necessarily true.  **Option E: \( x < -y \)**  Since \( x < 0 \) and \( y > 0 \), we can analyze this option. Rearranging gives us \( x + y < 0 \). However, we cannot directly conclude this from the given information. Therefore, this option is not necessarily true.  After analyzing all options, we find that none of the options must be true based on the given conditions. However, we can conclude that:  - The inequality \( -x^3 > y^2 \) suggests that \( -x^3 \) is a positive number greater than \( y^2 \), but it does not provide a definitive relationship between \( -x \) and \( y \).  Thus, the only conclusion we can draw is that none of the options must be true based on the provided conditions.  Final answer:  # None of the options must be true.",,2.0

Let: - \( x \) = number of trousers - \( y \) = number of shirts  The cost of trousers is Rs 70 each, and the cost of shirts is Rs 30 each. The total cost equation can be expressed as:  \[ 70x + 30y = 810 \]  To maximize the number of trousers \( x \), we can set \( y = 0 \) (which means no shirts are bought). This gives us:  \[ 70x = 810 \]  Now, we can solve for \( x \):  \[ x = \frac{810}{70} = 11.5714 \]  Since \( x \) must be a whole number, we take the maximum integer value, which is \( x = 11 \).  Now, substituting \( x = 11 \) back into the total cost equation to find \( y \):  \[ 70(11) + 30y = 810 \] \[ 770 + 30y = 810 \] \[ 30y = 810 - 770 \] \[ 30y = 40 \] \[ y = \frac{40}{30} = 1.3333 \]  Since \( y \) must also be a whole number, we can only buy 1 shirt if we want to maximize trousers.   Now, we can check the maximum number of trousers that can be bought while still allowing for at least one shirt.   If we buy 10 trousers, the cost would be:  \[ 70 \times 10 = 700 \]  This leaves us with:  \[ 810 - 700 = 110 \]  Now, we can buy shirts with the remaining Rs 110:  \[ 30y = 110 \implies y = \frac{110}{30} \approx 3.6667 \]  Thus, we can buy 3 shirts.   So, the maximum number of trousers we can buy while still being able to buy shirts is 10 trousers and 3 shirts.  The ratio of trousers to shirts is:  \[ \text{Ratio} = \frac{x}{y} = \frac{10}{3} \]  However, the question asks for the number of trousers when the maximum number of trousers is purchased.

The total cover price for 15 issues would then be:  \[ 15C \]  According to the problem, the subscription cost of $42.00 represents a saving of 25% off the cover price. This means that the subscription price is 75% of the total cover price. We can express this relationship mathematically as:  \[ 42 = 0.75 \times (15C) \]  To isolate \( 15C \), we can divide both sides by 0.75:  \[ 15C = \frac{42}{0.75} \]  Calculating the right side:  \[ \frac{42}{0.75} = 42 \div 0.75 = 42 \times \frac{100}{75} = 42 \times \frac{4}{3} = 56 \]  So, we have:  \[ 15C = 56 \]  Next, we solve for \( C \) by dividing both sides by 15:  \[ C = \frac{56}{15} \]  Calculating this gives:  \[ C = 3.7333\ldots \]  Rounding to two decimal places, we find:  \[ C \approx 3.73 \]  Thus, the cover price per issue is:  # 3.73",,3.73

The first row is M A D, which we can interpret as the number represented by MAD. 2. The second row is B E, which we can interpret as the number represented by BE. 3. The result of the multiplication of MAD and BE is given in the third row as R A E.  We can express this mathematically as: \[ (100m + 10a + d) \times (10b + e) = (100r + 10a + e) \]  Next, we need to analyze the options provided: - A) 9 2 0 0 - B) 9 2 0 9 - C) 9 2 0 1 - D) 9 2 0 7 - E) 9 2 2 2  We will test each option to see if it satisfies the multiplication condition.  ### Testing Option A: 9 2 0 0 Let’s assign: - M = 9 - A = 2 - D = 0 - B = 0 - E = 0 - R = 0  Calculating: \[ MAD = 920 \] \[ BE = 00 = 0 \] \[ 920 \times 0 = 0 \] This does not match RAE (which would be 000).  ### Testing Option B: 9 2 0 9 Let’s assign: - M = 9 - A = 2 - D = 0 - B = 0 - E = 9 - R = 0  Calculating: \[ MAD = 920 \] \[ BE = 09 = 9 \] \[ 920 \times 9 = 8280 \] This does not match RAE (which would be 009).  ### Testing Option C: 9 2 0 1 Let’s assign: - M = 9 - A = 2 - D = 0 - B = 0 - E = 1 - R = 0  Calculating: \[ MAD = 920 \] \[ BE = 01 = 1 \] \[ 920 \times 1 = 920 \] This does not match RAE (which would be 001).  ### Testing Option D: 9 2 0 7 Let’s assign: - M = 9 - A = 2 - D = 0 - B = 0 - E = 7 - R = 0  Calculating: \[ MAD = 920 \] \[ BE = 07 = 7 \] \[ 920 \times 7 = 6440 \] This does not match RAE (which would be 007).  ### Testing Option E: 9 2 2 2 Let’s assign: - M = 9 - A = 2 - D = 2 - B = 2 - E = 2 - R = 2  Calculating: \[ MAD = 922 \] \[ BE = 22 \] \[ 922 \times 22 = 20284 \] This does not match RAE (which would be 222).  After testing all options, none of them satisfy the multiplication condition. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the problem or the options provided.  However, based on the structure of the problem and the options given, it seems that the answer is likely to be one of the options provided.   Since none of the options seem to work, I will conclude that the answer is not determinable from the given options.  # 0",,0.0

How old is Ajay today if Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years ['A)18', 'B)25', 'C)15', 'D)20', 'E)21']",20,"Let's denote Ajay's current age as \( A \) and Sachin's current age as \( S \).  From the problem, we know that:  1. Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years. Therefore, his current age can be expressed as:    \[    S + 10 = 40    \]    Solving for \( S \):    \[    S = 40 - 10 = 30    \]  2. Ten years ago, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay. Ten years ago, their ages were:    - Sachin's age: \( S - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20 \)    - Ajay's age: \( A - 10 \)     According to the problem, we have:    \[    S - 10 = 2(A - 10)    \]    Substituting \( S = 30 \):    \[    20 = 2(A - 10)    \]    Dividing both sides by 2:    \[    10 = A - 10    \]    Adding 10 to both sides:    \[    A = 20    \]  Thus, Ajay's current age is 20 years.

Given that the perimeter is 340 metres, we have:    \[    2 \times (l + w) = 340    \]    Simplifying this gives:    \[    l + w = 170    \]  2. **Calculate the area of the rectangular plot:**    The area \( A \) of the rectangular plot is:    \[    A = l \times w    \]    However, we do not have specific values for \( l \) and \( w \), but we can still calculate the area of the boundary.  3. **Calculate the area of the boundary:**    The boundary is 1 metre wide, which means we need to consider the area of the larger rectangle formed by adding 1 metre to each side of the original rectangle.     The dimensions of the larger rectangle will be:    - Length: \( l + 2 \) (adding 1 metre on each side)    - Width: \( w + 2 \)     The area of the larger rectangle is:    \[    A_{larger} = (l + 2)(w + 2)    \]     Expanding this:    \[    A_{larger} = lw + 2l + 2w + 4    \]     The area of the original rectangle is \( A = lw \). Therefore, the area of the boundary is:    \[    A_{boundary} = A_{larger} - A = (lw + 2l + 2w + 4) - lw = 2l + 2w + 4    \]     Since \( l + w = 170 \):    \[    A_{boundary} = 2(170) + 4 = 340 + 4 = 344 \text{ square metres}    \]  4. **Calculate the cost of gardening:**    The cost of gardening is given at the rate of 10 per square metre. Therefore, the total cost is:    \[    \text{Cost} = A_{boundary} \times \text{rate} = 344 \times 10 = 3440    \]  Thus, the final answer is:  # 3440",,3440.0
"Last year, 34 percent of Ace Book Company's sales revenue came from the sale of novels. Of the remaining revenue, 1/3 was from the sale of biographies.

['A)1.3', 'B)1.5', 'C)2.1', 'D)2.5', 'E)3.1']",1.5,"Let the total sales revenue of Ace Book Company last year be denoted as \( R \).  From the problem, we know that: - The revenue from the sale of novels is 34% of \( R \). - The remaining revenue is \( R - 0.34R = 0.66R \). - Of this remaining revenue, \( \frac{1}{3} \) comes from the sale of biographies.  First, we calculate the revenue from the sale of biographies: \[ \text{Revenue from biographies} = \frac{1}{3} \times 0.66R = 0.22R \]  Next, we calculate the revenue from the sale of novels: \[ \text{Revenue from novels} = 0.34R \]  Now, we need to find how many times the revenue from novels is compared to the revenue from biographies: \[ \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Revenue from novels}}{\text{Revenue from biographies}} = \frac{0.34R}{0.22R} \]  The \( R \) cancels out: \[ \text{Ratio} = \frac{0.34}{0.22} \]  Now, we perform the division: \[ \frac{0.34}{0.22} \approx 1.545454545 \]  Rounding this to one decimal place gives us approximately \( 1.5 \).

The bee bypasses 0.05% of the flowers. This means that for every 100 flowers, the bee will bypass 0.05 flowers.   To find out how many flowers the bee needs to fly by to bypass 8 flowers, we can set up the following equation:  Let \( x \) be the total number of flowers the bee flies by. The number of flowers bypassed can be expressed as:  \[ \text{Bypassed flowers} = 0.0005 \times x \]  We want this to equal 8:  \[ 0.0005 \times x = 8 \]  Now, we can solve for \( x \):  \[ x = \frac{8}{0.0005} \]  Calculating the right side:  \[ x = 8 \div 0.0005 = 8 \times 2000 = 16000 \]  Thus, the bee needs to fly by 16,000 flowers to bypass 8 flowers.

The expression \(a^2 - b^2\) can be factored using the difference of squares:  \[ a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \]  Substituting this into our equation gives:  \[ \frac{(a - b)(a + b)}{(a + b)^2} \]  Now, we can simplify this fraction:  \[ \frac{(a - b)(a + b)}{(a + b)(a + b)} = \frac{a - b}{a + b} \]  So, we have:  \[ \frac{a - b}{a + b} = (a - b)^2 \]  Next, we can cross-multiply to eliminate the fraction:  \[ a - b = (a - b)^2 (a + b) \]  Now, let's analyze the right-hand side. We can expand \((a - b)^2\):  \[ (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2 \]  Thus, we have:  \[ a - b = (a^2 - 2ab + b^2)(a + b) \]  This expression is quite complex, so let's check the options provided to see if any of them can be derived from our original equation.

Therefore, B's work rate is:    \[    \text{Rate of B} = \frac{1 \text{ wall}}{45 \text{ min}} = \frac{1}{45} \text{ walls per minute}    \]  3. **Combine their work rates:**    When A and B work together, their combined work rate is the sum of their individual rates:    \[    \text{Combined Rate} = \text{Rate of A} + \text{Rate of B} = \frac{1}{40} + \frac{1}{45}    \]     To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 40 and 45 is 360. We convert each rate:    \[    \frac{1}{40} = \frac{9}{360}, \quad \frac{1}{45} = \frac{8}{360}    \]    Now, we can add them:    \[    \text{Combined Rate} = \frac{9}{360} + \frac{8}{360} = \frac{17}{360} \text{ walls per minute}    \]  4. **Calculate the time to complete one wall:**    To find the time \( t \) it takes to complete one wall together, we take the reciprocal of their combined rate:    \[    t = \frac{1 \text{ wall}}{\frac{17}{360} \text{ walls per minute}} = \frac{360}{17} \text{ minutes}    \]  5. **Convert minutes to a more understandable format:**    Now we calculate \( \frac{360}{17} \):    \[    360 \div 17 \approx 21.176 \text{ minutes}    \]     This is approximately 21 minutes and 11 seconds.

Therefore, we need to divide the result by 2:     \[    \text{Number of ways to create the groups} = \frac{252}{2} = 126    \]  Thus, the total number of ways to create the two groups of 5 members each from 10 members is 126.  The final answer is:  # 126",,126.0
"A special cereal mixture contains rice, wheat and corn in the ratio of 2:3:5. If a bag of the mixture contains 3 pounds of rice, how much corn does it contain? ['A)6.5', 'B)7.5', 'C)7', 'D)6', 'E)None of the above']",7.5,"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the ratio of rice, wheat, and corn in the mixture, which is given as 2:3:5. This means that for every 2 parts of rice, there are 3 parts of wheat and 5 parts of corn.  Let's denote the parts of rice, wheat, and corn as follows: - Rice = 2 parts - Wheat = 3 parts - Corn = 5 parts  The total number of parts in the mixture is: \[  2 + 3 + 5 = 10 \text{ parts}  \]  Next, we know that the amount of rice in the mixture is 3 pounds. Since rice corresponds to 2 parts of the total 10 parts, we can set up a proportion to find the weight of one part:  Let \( x \) be the weight of one part. Then: \[  2x = 3 \text{ pounds}  \]  To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 2: \[  x = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ pounds per part}  \]  Now, we can find the amount of corn, which corresponds to 5 parts: \[  \text{Corn} = 5x = 5 \times 1.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}  \]  Thus, the amount of corn in the mixture is 7.5 pounds.  Finally, we present the answer:  # 7.5",,7.5

We can set up the following equations based on the information provided:  1. From the first scenario (one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents):    \[    s + 2e = 150    \]  2. From the second scenario (two sodas and three energy bars for 300 cents):    \[    2s + 3e = 300    \]  Now we have a system of linear equations:  \[ \begin{align*} (1) & \quad s + 2e = 150 \\ (2) & \quad 2s + 3e = 300 \end{align*} \]  We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use the substitution method. From equation (1), we can express \( s \) in terms of \( e \):  \[ s = 150 - 2e \]  Now, substitute \( s \) into equation (2):  \[ 2(150 - 2e) + 3e = 300 \]  Expanding this gives:  \[ 300 - 4e + 3e = 300 \]  Simplifying, we find:  \[ 300 - e = 300 \]  This leads to:  \[ -e = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad e = 0 \]  Substituting \( e = 0 \) back into equation (1):  \[ s + 2(0) = 150 \quad \Rightarrow \quad s = 150 \]  Now we have the costs: - Cost of one soda \( s = 150 \) cents - Cost of one energy bar \( e = 0 \) cents  Next, we need to compute the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars:  \[ \text{Total cost} = 6s + 7e = 6(150) + 7(0) = 900 + 0 = 900 \text{ cents} \]  Thus, the final answer is:  # 900",,900.0

This means that the total cost (C) can be calculated using the formula for profit:    \[    \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}    \]    Given that the profit is 25% of the total cost, we can express this as:    \[    \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Total Cost} + 0.25 \times \text{Total Cost} = 1.25 \times \text{Total Cost}    \]    Rearranging gives:    \[    \text{Total Cost} = \frac{\text{Total Revenue}}{1.25} = \frac{72000}{1.25} = Rs. 57600    \]  3. **Calculate the number of pens manufactured**:    Since 10% of the pens are defective, only 90% of the manufactured pens are good. Let \( x \) be the total number of pens manufactured. Then:    \[    0.9x = 7200 \implies x = \frac{7200}{0.9} = 8000    \]  4. **Calculate the manufactured cost per pen**:    The manufactured cost per pen (M) can be calculated as:    \[    M = \frac{\text{Total Cost}}{\text{Total Number of Pens Manufactured}} = \frac{57600}{8000} = Rs. 7.2    \]  Thus, the manufactured cost of each pen is:  # Rs. 7.2",,7.2

The number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18:    \[    10a + b = (a + b) + 18    \]    Simplifying this, we get:    \[    10a + b = a + b + 18    \]    \[    10a - a = 18    \]    \[    9a = 18    \]    \[    a = 2    \]  2.

"Suppose for any real number x, [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x. Let L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] and R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y].

Therefore, we can express \( L(x,y) \) as:    - If \( \alpha + \beta < 1 \):      \[      L(x,y) = a + b + (a + b) = 2a + 2b      \]    - If \( \alpha + \beta \geq 1 \):      \[      L(x,y) = a + b + (a + b + 1) = 2a + 2b + 1      \]  2. **Understanding \( R(x,y) \)**:    \[    R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]    \]    We can express \( [2x] \) and \( [2y] \) as:    \[    [2x] = [2(a + \alpha)] = [2a + 2\alpha] = 2a + [2\alpha]    \]    \[    [2y] = [2(b + \beta)] = [2b + 2\beta] = 2b + [2\beta]    \]    Thus,    \[    R(x,y) = (2a + [2\alpha]) + (2b + [2\beta]) = 2a + 2b + [2\alpha] + [2\beta]    \]     Here, \( [2\alpha] \) is 0 if \( \alpha < 0.5 \) and 1 if \( \alpha \geq 0.5 \), and similarly for \( [2\beta] \).  3. **Comparing \( L(x,y) \) and \( R(x,y) \)**:    - If \( \alpha + \beta < 1 \):      \[      L(x,y) = 2a + 2b      \]      - If \( \alpha < 0.5 \) and \( \beta < 0.5 \):        \[        R(x,y) = 2a + 2b + 0 + 0 = 2a + 2b        \]        Thus, \( L(x,y) = R(x,y) \).      - If \( \alpha \geq 0.5 \) or \( \beta \geq 0.5 \):        \[        R(x,y) = 2a + 2b + 1 \text{ or } 2a + 2b + 0 + 1        \]        Thus, \( L(x,y) < R(x,y) \).     - If \( \alpha + \beta \geq 1 \):      \[      L(x,y) = 2a + 2b + 1      \]      - If \( \alpha < 0.5 \) and \( \beta < 0.5 \):        \[        R(x,y) = 2a + 2b + 0 + 0 = 2a + 2b        \]        Thus, \( L(x,y) > R(x,y) \).      - If \( \alpha \geq 0.5 \) or \( \beta \geq 0.5 \):        \[        R(x,y) = 2a + 2b + 1 \text{ or } 2a + 2b + 0 + 1        \]        Thus, \( L(x,y) = R(x,y) \).

Therefore, the LCM is:    \[    LCM = 2^4 \times 3^2 \times 5^1    \]  3. **Calculating the LCM**:    - Calculate \(2^4 = 16\)    - Calculate \(3^2 = 9\)    - Calculate \(5^1 = 5\)     Now, multiply these together:    \[    LCM = 16 \times 9 \times 5    \]     First, calculate \(16 \times 9\):    \[    16 \times 9 = 144    \]     Now, multiply \(144 \times 5\):    \[    144 \times 5 = 720    \]  Thus, the LCM of 36, 40, and 48 seconds is 720 seconds.  4. **Convert seconds to minutes**:    To convert seconds to minutes, divide by 60:    \[    \frac{720}{60} = 12 \text{ minutes}    \]  Therefore, the three bells will ring together again after 12 minutes.

The height of the electric pole and its shadow form one triangle, while the height of the tree and its shadow form another triangle. Since the conditions are similar, the ratios of the heights to the lengths of the shadows will be equal.  Let: - \( h_p = 14 \) meters (height of the electric pole) - \( s_p = 10 \) meters (shadow of the electric pole) - \( h_t \) = height of the tree (unknown) - \( s_t = 15 \) meters (shadow of the tree)  According to the property of similar triangles, we have:  \[ \frac{h_p}{s_p} = \frac{h_t}{s_t} \]  Substituting the known values into the equation:  \[ \frac{14}{10} = \frac{h_t}{15} \]  Now, we can cross-multiply to solve for \( h_t \):  \[ 14 \cdot 15 = 10 \cdot h_t \]  Calculating the left side:  \[ 210 = 10 \cdot h_t \]  Now, divide both sides by 10 to isolate \( h_t \):  \[ h_t = \frac{210}{10} = 21 \]  Thus, the height of the tree is 21 meters.

One possible approach is to examine the number of vowels in the names of the fruits and see if there's a correlation with their prices.  1. **Orange**: 3 vowels (o, a, e) - Price: 18 dollars 2. **Pineapple**: 4 vowels (i, e, a, e) - Price: 27 dollars 3. **Grape**: 2 vowels (a, e) - Price: 15 dollars  Now, let's calculate the price per vowel for each fruit:  - Orange: 18 dollars / 3 vowels = 6 dollars per vowel - Pineapple: 27 dollars / 4 vowels = 6.75 dollars per vowel - Grape: 15 dollars / 2 vowels = 7.5 dollars per vowel  The prices per vowel do not seem to follow a consistent pattern. Let's try another approach by looking at the total number of letters in each fruit's name:  1. **Orange**: 6 letters - Price: 18 dollars 2. **Pineapple**: 9 letters - Price: 27 dollars 3. **Grape**: 5 letters - Price: 15 dollars  Now, let's calculate the price per letter for each fruit:  - Orange: 18 dollars / 6 letters = 3 dollars per letter - Pineapple: 27 dollars / 9 letters = 3 dollars per letter - Grape: 15 dollars / 5 letters = 3 dollars per letter  This shows that each fruit costs 3 dollars per letter.  Now, let's apply this to the mango:  - **Mango**: 5 letters  Using the price per letter:  Price of mango = 5 letters * 3 dollars per letter = 15 dollars.

Therefore, we can rewrite the area as:  \[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot |y| \cdot (a - b) \]  Since \(y\) is negative, \(|y| = -y\).

"Three friends Alan, Roger and Peter attempt to answer a question on an exam. Alan randomly guesses the answer, giving him a 1/5 probability of guessing correctly.

What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating? ['A)1/18', 'B)1/9', 'C)23/90', 'D)5/18', 'E)13/45']",1/18,"To find the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating, we need to consider the probabilities of Alan and Peter answering correctly, since Roger's method involves cheating.  1. **Probability of Alan answering correctly**:     - Alan guesses randomly, so the probability \( P(A) \) that he answers correctly is \( \frac{1}{5} \).  2. **Probability of Peter answering correctly**:     - Peter performs calculations, so the probability \( P(P) \) that he answers correctly is \( \frac{5}{6} \).  3. **Probability of Alan answering incorrectly**:     - The probability that Alan answers incorrectly is \( P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 1 - \frac{1}{5} = \frac{4}{5} \).  4. **Probability of Peter answering incorrectly**:     - The probability that Peter answers incorrectly is \( P(P') = 1 - P(P) = 1 - \frac{5}{6} = \frac{1}{6} \).  Now, we want to find the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. This can be calculated using the law of total probability.  The event that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter can be expressed as: - The event that Alan answers correctly and Peter does not answer incorrectly, or - The event that Peter answers correctly and Alan does not answer incorrectly.  Thus, we can calculate the probability of the question being answered correctly by Alan or Peter as follows:  - **Probability that Alan answers correctly and Peter answers incorrectly**:   \[   P(A \cap P') = P(A) \cdot P(P') = \frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{30}   \]  - **Probability that Peter answers correctly and Alan answers incorrectly**:   \[   P(P \cap A') = P(P) \cdot P(A') = \frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}   \]  Now, we need to add these two probabilities together to find the total probability that the question is answered correctly without cheating: \[ P(\text{correct without cheating}) = P(A \cap P') + P(P \cap A') = \frac{1}{30} + \frac{2}{3} \]  To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 30 and 3 is 30. Thus, we convert \( \frac{2}{3} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 30: \[ \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2 \times 10}{3 \times 10} = \frac{20}{30} \]  Now we can add: \[ P(\text{correct without cheating}) = \frac{1}{30} + \frac{20}{30} = \frac{21}{30} = \frac{7}{10} \]  However, we need to ensure that we are only considering the cases where the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger. Since Roger's probability of answering correctly is independent of Alan and Peter, we can conclude that the probability of answering correctly without cheating is simply the sum of the probabilities of Alan and Peter answering correctly.  Thus, the final probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating is: \[ P(\text{correct}) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A \cap P) = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{5}{6} - 0 \]  Calculating this gives: \[ P(\text{correct}) = \frac{6}{30} + \frac{25}{30} = \frac{31}{30} \]  This is incorrect as it exceeds 1. We need to consider the independent probabilities correctly.  The correct approach is to find the probability that at least one of them answers correctly without cheating: \[ P(\text{correct}) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A \cap P) \] Where \( P(A \cap P) = P(A) \cdot P(P) \) since they are independent.  Thus, we need to recalculate: \[ P(A \cap P) = \frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{5}{6} = \frac{1}{6} \]  So: \[ P(\text{correct}) = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{5}{6} - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{6}{30} + \frac{25}{30} - \frac{5}{30} = \frac{26}{30} = \frac{13}{15} \]  This is still incorrect as we need to find the probability of answering correctly without cheating.  The final answer is: \[ P(\text{correct without cheating}) = \frac{1}{30} + \frac{20}{30} = \frac{21}{30} = \frac{7}{10} \]  Thus, the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating is:  # 13/45",,45.0

The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:     \[    V = \pi r^2 h    \]     where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height (thickness).      The radius \( r \) is half of the diameter:     \[    r = \frac{15 \text{ mm}}{2} = 7.5 \text{ mm}    \]     The height \( h \) is 2 mm. Now we can calculate the volume:     \[    V = \pi (7.5 \text{ mm})^2 (2 \text{ mm}) = \pi (56.25 \text{ mm}^2) (2 \text{ mm}) = 112.5\pi \text{ mm}^3    \]  2. **Determine the weight of aluminum and silver in the original coin:**    The total weight of the coin is 30 grams, and the volume of aluminum equals the volume of silver. Let \( V_a \) be the volume of aluminum and \( V_s \) be the volume of silver.

According to the problem, if 10 is subtracted from \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the number, the result is equal to the sum of 40 and \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the number. We can set up the equation as follows:  \[ \frac{2}{3}x - 10 = 40 + \frac{1}{3}x \]  Now, let's solve for \( x \).  First, we can eliminate the fractions by multiplying the entire equation by 3:  \[ 3\left(\frac{2}{3}x - 10\right) = 3\left(40 + \frac{1}{3}x\right) \]  This simplifies to:  \[ 2x - 30 = 120 + x \]  Next, we will isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( x \) from both sides:  \[ 2x - x - 30 = 120 \]  This simplifies to:  \[ x - 30 = 120 \]  Now, add 30 to both sides:  \[ x = 120 + 30 \]  Thus, we find:  \[ x = 150 \]  Now, we can check our solution by substituting \( x = 150 \) back into the original condition:  Calculating \( \frac{2}{3} \) of 150:  \[ \frac{2}{3} \times 150 = 100 \]  Now, subtracting 10:  \[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]  Calculating \( \frac{1}{3} \) of 150:  \[ \frac{1}{3} \times 150 = 50 \]  Now, adding 40 to \( \frac{1}{3} \) of 150:  \[ 40 + 50 = 90 \]  Since both sides are equal, our solution is confirmed.

Now, we check the options provided:  - A) 9 - B) 7 - C) 3 - D) 8 - E) 12  None of these options include \( 6 \). However, we need to ensure that we are looking for the largest \( k \) that satisfies the condition. The largest integer less than \( 6.25 \) is indeed \( 6 \), but since it is not listed, we need to check the next largest integers from the options.  Let's check \( k = 7 \):  \[ D = 25 - 4 \cdot 7 = 25 - 28 = -3 \quad (\text{not real and distinct}) \]  Now check \( k = 8 \):  \[ D = 25 - 4 \cdot 8 = 25 - 32 = -7 \quad (\text{not real and distinct}) \]  Now check \( k = 9 \):  \[ D = 25 - 4 \cdot 9 = 25 - 36 = -11 \quad (\text{not real and distinct}) \]  Now check \( k = 3 \):  \[ D = 25 - 4 \cdot 3 = 25 - 12 = 13 \quad (\text{real and distinct}) \]  Thus, the largest integral value of \( k \) that allows for real and distinct roots is \( 3 \).

Since 60% of the people surveyed were women, the number of women is: \[ 0.6x \] Thus, the number of men surveyed is: \[ x - 0.6x = 0.4x \]  According to the problem, 75% of the men preferred red cars. Therefore, the number of men who preferred red cars is: \[ 0.75 \times 0.4x = 0.3x \]  The remaining men, who preferred green cars, would then be: \[ 0.4x - 0.3x = 0.1x \]  We are given that 10 men liked green cars more than red cars. Therefore, we can set up the equation: \[ 0.1x = 10 \]  To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \): \[ x = \frac{10}{0.1} = 100 \]  Thus, the total number of people who took the survey is: \[ \boxed{100} \]  Finally, we present the answer as requested:  # 100",,100.0

Let \( f(n) \) represent the number of ways to reach the \( n \)-th step. The boy can reach the \( n \)-th step in two ways: 1. From the \( (n-1) \)-th step by taking a single step. 2. From the \( (n-2) \)-th step by taking two steps.  This gives us the recurrence relation: \[ f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) \]  We need to establish the base cases: - \( f(0) = 1 \): There is one way to be on the ground (doing nothing). - \( f(1) = 1 \): There is one way to reach the first step (one single step).  Now we can compute \( f(n) \) for \( n = 2 \) to \( n = 10 \):  \[ \begin{align*} f(2) & = f(1) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2 \\ f(3) & = f(2) + f(1) = 2 + 1 = 3 \\ f(4) & = f(3) + f(2) = 3 + 2 = 5 \\ f(5) & = f(4) + f(3) = 5 + 3 = 8 \\ f(6) & = f(5) + f(4) = 8 + 5 = 13 \\ f(7) & = f(6) + f(5) = 13 + 8 = 21 \\ f(8) & = f(7) + f(6) = 21 + 13 = 34 \\ f(9) & = f(8) + f(7) = 34 + 21 = 55 \\ f(10) & = f(9) + f(8) = 55 + 34 = 89 \\ \end{align*} \]  Thus, the number of ways the boy can reach the top of the 10 steps is \( f(10) = 89 \).

Let's denote the horses as H1, H2, H3, H4, and H5. Assume that one of these horses is the winning horse.  1. **Total Ways to Select 2 Horses**: The total number of ways to choose 2 horses from 5 is given by the combination formula \( C(n, k) \), where \( n \) is the total number of items to choose from, and \( k \) is the number of items to choose. Thus, we have:    \[    C(5, 2) = \frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10    \]  2. **Ways to Select 2 Horses Including the Winning Horse**: If we assume one specific horse (say H1) is the winning horse, then we need to select 1 more horse from the remaining 4 horses (H2, H3, H4, H5). The number of ways to do this is:    \[    C(4, 1) = 4    \]  3. **Probability Calculation**: The probability that Mr. Jain selects at least one winning horse is the number of favorable outcomes (selecting 2 horses that include the winning horse) divided by the total outcomes (selecting any 2 horses).

According to the problem, when we divide both 2272 and 875 by \( N \), we get the same remainder. This can be expressed mathematically as:  \[ 2272 \equiv 875 \mod N \]  This implies that the difference between 2272 and 875 is divisible by \( N \):  \[ 2272 - 875 = 1397 \]  Thus, we have:  \[ 1397 \equiv 0 \mod N \]  This means that \( N \) must be a divisor of 1397. Next, we need to find the divisors of 1397. First, we will check if 1397 is a prime number or find its prime factorization.  To check if 1397 is prime, we can test divisibility by prime numbers up to \( \sqrt{1397} \approx 37.4 \). The prime numbers to check are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37.  - **Divisibility by 2**: 1397 is odd, so not divisible. - **Divisibility by 3**: The sum of the digits \( 1 + 3 + 9 + 7 = 20 \) is not divisible by 3. - **Divisibility by 5**: The last digit is 7, so not divisible. - **Divisibility by 7**: \( 1397 \div 7 \approx 199.57 \) (not an integer). - **Divisibility by 11**: \( 1397 \div 11 \approx 127.00 \) (exactly divisible).  Now, we can perform the division:  \[ 1397 \div 11 = 127 \]  Thus, we have:  \[ 1397 = 11 \times 127 \]  Next, we check if 127 is prime. The primes to check are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11 (up to \( \sqrt{127} \approx 11.3 \)):  - **Divisibility by 2**: 127 is odd, so not divisible. - **Divisibility by 3**: The sum of the digits \( 1 + 2 + 7 = 10 \) is not divisible by 3. - **Divisibility by 5**: The last digit is 7, so not divisible. - **Divisibility by 7**: \( 127 \div 7 \approx 18.14 \) (not an integer). - **Divisibility by 11**: \( 127 \div 11 \approx 11.545 \) (not an integer).  Since 127 is not divisible by any of these primes, it is a prime number.  Thus, the prime factorization of 1397 is:  \[ 1397 = 11 \times 127 \]  The divisors of 1397 are \( 1, 11, 127, \) and \( 1397 \). Since we are looking for a 3-digit number \( N \), the only suitable divisor is \( 127 \).  Next, we find the sum of the digits of \( N = 127 \):  \[ 1 + 2 + 7 = 10 \]  Thus, the sum of the digits of \( N \) is 10.  Finally, we present the answer:  # 10",,10.0

Therefore, the total wages for the last 7 days is:    \[    \text{Total wages for last 7 days} = 7 \times 92 = 644    \]  4. **Finding the wage on the 8th day:**    The total wages for the first 7 days and the last 7 days together account for 14 days. The total wages for these 14 days is:    \[    \text{Total wages for first 7 days + last 7 days} = 609 + 644 = 1253    \]    Now, to find the wage on the 8th day, we subtract the total wages for the first 14 days from the total wages for all 15 days:    \[    \text{Wage on 8th day} = \text{Total wages for 15 days} - \text{Total wages for first 14 days} = 1350 - 1253 = 97    \]  Thus, the wage on the 8th day is $97.  # 97",,97.0

['A)11', 'B)10', 'C)9', 'D)8', 'E)7']",11,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the value of \( n \) such that the number of ways to select 2 balls from the box, excluding the ball marked with the number 3, equals 45.  1. **Understanding the Selection**:     If the ball marked with number 3 is not selected, we can only choose from the remaining \( n - 1 \) balls (since we have \( n \) balls in total and we are excluding one).  2. **Calculating Combinations**:     The number of ways to choose 2 balls from \( n - 1 \) balls is given by the combination formula:    \[    \binom{n-1}{2} = \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}    \]    We set this equal to 45:    \[    \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} = 45    \]  3. **Solving the Equation**:    To eliminate the fraction, we multiply both sides by 2:    \[    (n-1)(n-2) = 90    \]  4. **Expanding and Rearranging**:    Expanding the left side gives:    \[    n^2 - 3n + 2 = 90    \]    Rearranging this, we get:    \[    n^2 - 3n - 88 = 0    \]  5. **Using the Quadratic Formula**:    We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:    \[    n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}    \]    Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -3 \), and \( c = -88 \):    \[    n = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-88)}}{2 \cdot 1}    \]    \[    n = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 352}}{2}    \]    \[    n = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{361}}{2}    \]    \[    n = \frac{3 \pm 19}{2}    \]  6. **Calculating the Possible Values**:    This gives us two potential solutions:    \[    n = \frac{22}{2} = 11 \quad \text{and} \quad n = \frac{-16}{2} = -8    \]    Since \( n \) must be a positive integer, we take \( n = 11 \).  7. **Final Answer**:    Thus, the value of \( n \) is:  # 11",,11.0
"If Q, a positive integer, has 5 factors, which of the following must be true about Q?
I. Q is the square of a prime number.
II. Q is the fourth power of a prime number.
III. Q is the product of two prime numbers. ['A)I only', 'B)III only', 'C)II only', 'D)I and II only', 'E)I and III only']",III only,"To determine which statements about the positive integer \( Q \) with exactly 5 factors are true, we need to analyze the conditions under which a number has a specific number of factors.  The number of factors \( d(n) \) of a positive integer \( n \) can be determined from its prime factorization. If \( n \) can be expressed as:  \[ n = p_1^{e_1} \times p_2^{e_2} \times \ldots \times p_k^{e_k} \]  where \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k \) are distinct prime numbers and \( e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_k \) are their respective positive integer exponents, then the total number of factors \( d(n) \) is given by:  \[ d(n) = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1) \]  For \( Q \) to have exactly 5 factors, we need to find combinations of \( (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1) = 5 \).  The number 5 is prime, so the only way to express it as a product of integers greater than 1 is:  \[ 5 = 5 \times 1 \times 1 \times \ldots \times 1 \]  This means that \( Q \) must be of the form \( p^4 \) for some prime \( p \). In this case, \( e_1 = 4 \) and there are no other prime factors (i.e., \( k = 1 \)).  Now, let's evaluate the statements:  I. **Q is the square of a prime number.**    - If \( Q = p^2 \), then the number of factors would be \( (2 + 1) = 3 \), which does not satisfy our condition. Therefore, this statement is false.  II. **Q is the fourth power of a prime number.**    - If \( Q = p^4 \), then the number of factors would be \( (4 + 1) = 5 \), which satisfies our condition. Therefore, this statement is true.  III. **Q is the product of two prime numbers.**    - If \( Q = p_1 \times p_2 \) (where \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \) are distinct primes), then the number of factors would be \( (1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4 \), which does not satisfy our condition. Therefore, this statement is false.  Based on the analysis, the only true statement is II.  Thus, the correct answer is:  # C",,4.0

['A)1', 'B)2', 'C)3', 'D)4', 'E)5']",4,"To determine the minimum number of DVDs you need to rent to make purchasing the membership worthwhile, we can set up an equation comparing the costs of renting DVDs with and without the membership.  Let \( x \) be the number of DVDs rented.  1. **Cost without membership**:     - Renting DVDs costs $4.00 each.    - Total cost without membership = \( 4x \).  2. **Cost with membership**:     - Membership costs $7.00 per month.    - Renting DVDs costs $2.00 each with membership.    - Total cost with membership = \( 7 + 2x \).  We want to find the smallest integer \( x \) such that the cost with membership is less than or equal to the cost without membership:  \[ 7 + 2x \leq 4x \]  Now, we can solve this inequality:  1. Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides:  \[ 7 \leq 4x - 2x \]  This simplifies to:  \[ 7 \leq 2x \]  2. Divide both sides by 2:  \[ \frac{7}{2} \leq x \]  This means:  \[ x \geq 3.5 \]  Since \( x \) must be a whole number (you can't rent a fraction of a DVD), we round up to the next whole number:  \[ x = 4 \]  Now, let's verify:  - If you rent 4 DVDs without membership:    \[   4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ dollars}   \]  - If you rent 4 DVDs with membership:    \[   7 + 2 \times 4 = 7 + 8 = 15 \text{ dollars}   \]  Since renting 4 DVDs with membership costs $15, which is less than $16 without membership, it is worth it to purchase the membership.  If you rent 3 DVDs:  - Without membership:    \[   4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ dollars}   \]  - With membership:    \[   7 + 2 \times 3 = 7 + 6 = 13 \text{ dollars}   \]  In this case, renting 3 DVDs with membership costs $13, which is more than $12 without membership.

The formula for the future value \( A \) of an investment compounded semi-annually is given by:  \[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \]  where: - \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest. - \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money). - \( r \) is the annual interest rate (decimal). - \( n \) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year. - \( t \) is the number of years the money is invested or borrowed.  In this case: - \( A = 54,080 \) - \( r = 0.08 \) (8 percent) - \( n = 2 \) (since the interest is compounded semi-annually) - \( t = 1 \)  We need to solve for \( P \). Plugging in the values, we have:  \[ 54,080 = P \left(1 + \frac{0.08}{2}\right)^{2 \cdot 1} \]  Calculating the term inside the parentheses:  \[ 1 + \frac{0.08}{2} = 1 + 0.04 = 1.04 \]  Now, raising this to the power of \( 2 \):  \[ (1.04)^2 = 1.0816 \]  Now we can substitute this back into the equation:  \[ 54,080 = P \cdot 1.0816 \]  To find \( P \), we divide both sides by \( 1.0816 \):  \[ P = \frac{54,080}{1.0816} \]  Calculating this gives:  \[ P \approx 50,000 \]  Thus, the amount of money that Charles originally invested is:  # 50000",,50000.0
"Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe’s fathers age sums up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father? ['A)45', 'B)48', 'C)50', 'D)55', 'E)58']",50,"Let \( j \) be Joe's age, \( s \) be Joe's sister's age, and \( f \) be Joe's father's age. We have the following equations based on the problem statement:  1. \( j + s + f = 100 \) (the sum of their ages) 2. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as she is now. This means that the difference in age between Joe and his father is \( f - j \), and in that time, Joe's sister will age by \( f - j \) years. Therefore, we can express this as:    \[    s + (f - j) = 2s    \]    Simplifying this gives:    \[    f - j = s    \]    or    \[    f = j + s    \]  3. When Joe is as old as his father, his father will be twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. The age of Joe's father when Joe is as old as him will be \( f \). The time it takes for Joe to reach his father's age is \( f - j \). At that time, Joe's sister will be \( s + (f - j) \) years old. We need to find out how old Joe's sister was when her father was her age. This means we need to find the age of the father at that time, which is \( f - (s + (f - j)) \).     Setting up the equation:    \[    f = 2 \left( f - (s + (f - j)) \right)    \]    Simplifying this gives:    \[    f = 2(f - s - f + j)    \]    \[    f = 2(j - s)    \]    or    \[    f = 2j - 2s    \]  Now we have two equations for \( f \): 1. \( f = j + s \) 2. \( f = 2j - 2s \)  Setting these equal to each other: \[ j + s = 2j - 2s \] Rearranging gives: \[ 3s = j \] Thus, we can express Joe's age in terms of his sister's age: \[ j = 3s \]  Now substituting \( j = 3s \) into the first equation \( j + s + f = 100 \): \[ 3s + s + f = 100 \] \[ 4s + f = 100 \] From \( f = j + s \): \[ f = 3s + s = 4s \] Substituting \( f = 4s \) into \( 4s + f = 100 \): \[ 4s + 4s = 100 \] \[ 8s = 100 \] \[ s = 12.5 \]  Now substituting \( s \) back to find \( j \) and \( f \): \[ j = 3s = 3 \times 12.5 = 37.5 \] \[ f = 4s = 4 \times 12.5 = 50 \]  Thus, Joe's father's age is: # 50",,50.0

"If m > 0, y > 0, and x is m percent of 4y, then, in terms of y, m is what percentage of x? ['A)y/400', 'B)4y', 'C)50y', 'D)2500/y', 'E)5000/y']",2500/y,"To solve the problem, we start by expressing \( x \) in terms of \( m \) and \( y \).  Given that \( x \) is \( m \) percent of \( 4y \), we can write this as:  \[ x = \frac{m}{100} \cdot 4y \]  Now, we want to find out what percentage \( m \) is of \( x \). To do this, we can express \( m \) as a percentage of \( x \) using the formula:  \[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{part}}{\text{whole}} \right) \times 100 \]  In our case, the ""part"" is \( m \) and the ""whole"" is \( x \):  \[ \text{Percentage of } m \text{ in } x = \left( \frac{m}{x} \right) \times 100 \]  Substituting the expression for \( x \):  \[ \text{Percentage of } m \text{ in } x = \left( \frac{m}{\frac{m}{100} \cdot 4y} \right) \times 100 \]  Simplifying the fraction:  \[ = \left( \frac{m \cdot 100}{m \cdot 4y} \right) \]  The \( m \) in the numerator and denominator cancels out (since \( m > 0 \)):  \[ = \frac{100}{4y} \]  Now, simplifying \( \frac{100}{4y} \):  \[ = \frac{25}{y} \]  Thus, \( m \) is \( \frac{25}{y} \) percent of \( x \).   Now, we need to find which of the given options corresponds to \( \frac{25}{y} \).   None of the options directly match \( \frac{25}{y} \), but we can express \( \frac{25}{y} \) in a different form.   To find a match, we can rewrite \( \frac{25}{y} \) as:  \[ \frac{2500}{100y} = \frac{2500/y}{100} \]  This indicates that \( \frac{25}{y} \) is equivalent to \( \frac{2500}{y} \) when considering the percentage.

Therefore, he has 6 options for breakfast.  2. **Dinner Choices**: The man has 8 different types of vegetables. Therefore, he has 8 options for dinner.  Since the choices for breakfast and dinner are independent of each other, we can find the total number of combinations by multiplying the number of choices for breakfast by the number of choices for dinner.  Total combinations = (Number of breakfast choices) × (Number of dinner choices)  Calculating this gives:  Total combinations = 6 (fruits) × 8 (vegetables) = 48  Thus, the total number of ways he can eat breakfast and dinner is 48.  # 48",,48.0

According to the problem, Alice is leaving one side of the yard unfenced, which we can assume is the length \( L \) of 10 meters. Therefore, we have:  \[ L = 10 \text{ meters} \]  The area of the rectangular yard is given by:  \[ \text{Area} = L \times W = 240 \text{ square meters} \]  Substituting the value of \( L \):  \[ 10 \times W = 240 \]  To find \( W \), we divide both sides by 10:  \[ W = \frac{240}{10} = 24 \text{ meters} \]  Now, Alice needs to fence three sides of the yard. The sides that need fencing are:  1. One length (which is 10 meters, but since it's unfenced, we won't count it) 2. Two widths (each of which is 24 meters)  Thus, the total length of fencing required is:  \[ \text{Total fencing} = W + W + L = 24 + 24 + 10 = 58 \text{ meters} \]  However, since the length of 10 meters is unfenced, we only need to consider the two widths and one length:  \[ \text{Total fencing} = 24 + 24 = 48 \text{ meters} \]  But we need to add the length of the unfenced side, which is not included in the fencing calculation.
