When the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60°, the car has traveled a horizontal distance $x$ such that $\tan(60^\circ) = \frac{h}{d+x}$ and $\tan(45^\circ) = \frac{h}{d}$.   Solving these equations, we get $d = h(\sqrt{3}-1)$ and $x = h$.   Therefore, the total distance the car needs to travel to reach the base of the tower is $d+x = h(\sqrt{3}-1) + h = h(\sqrt{3} + 1)$.  The time taken to travel this distance is the same as the time taken to change the angle of elevation from 45° to 60°, which is 10 minutes.  So, the car will reach the base of the tower after 10 more minutes.  # $10$",,10.0

After the first 20 marbles were pulled out and painted black, the number of black marbles in the bag increased by 20, but the total number of marbles in the bag remained the same.   Let $x$ be the number of black marbles in the bag initially. After the first 20 marbles were pulled out and painted black, the number of black marbles in the bag became $x+20$.   Now, after the second 20 marbles were pulled out, 1 of them was black. This means that the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time is $\frac{1}{20} \times 100\% = 5\%$.   Since the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, we can set up the following equation:  \[\frac{x+20}{Q} = 0.05\]  Solving for $Q$:  \[x+20 = 0.05Q\] \[x = 0.05Q - 20\]  Since the total number of marbles in the bag is $Q$, the total number of black marbles in the bag is $0.05Q - 20$.   Now, we know that initially there were $x$ black marbles in the bag. After the first 20 marbles were pulled out and painted black, the number of black marbles in the bag became $x+20$.

Given that: - $\frac{1}{16}x$ students study math, - $\frac{1}{10}x$ students study bio, - $\frac{1}{8}x$ students study English.  To find the minimum number of students, we assume that the number of students is the smallest 4-digit number, which is 1000.  So, the number of students studying math is $\frac{1}{16} \times 1000 = 62.5$, which we round up to 63. The number of students studying bio is $\frac{1}{10} \times 1000 = 100$. The number of students studying English is $\frac{1}{8} \times 1000 = 125$.  Therefore, the minimum number of students is $63 + 100 + 125 = 288$.  To find the maximum number of students, we assume that the number of students is the largest 4-digit number, which is 9999.  So, the number of students studying math is $\frac{1}{16} \times 9999 \approx 624.94$, which we round down to 624.

From the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we know that: $|C \cup S| = |C| + |S| - |C \cap S|$  Since $|C \cap S| = 0.24|D|$ and $|C \cup S| = |D|$, we have: $|D| = |C| + |S| - 0.24|D|$  Rearranging the equation, we get: $|S| = 1.24|D| - |C|$  Substitute $|S - C| = 0.20|S|$ into the equation: $|S| = 1.24|D| - |C| = 1.24|D| - 0.20|S|$  Rearranging the equation, we get: $1.20|S| = 1.24|D|$  Dividing both sides by $|D|$: $1.20\frac{|S|}{|D|} = 1.24$  Therefore, $\frac{|S|}{|D|} = \frac{1.24}{1.20} = 1.0333...$  To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: $\frac{|S|}{|D|} = 103.33... \%$  Therefore, the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team is approximately 103.33%, which is closest to 100%, or option D) 50%.  # Answer  # D)50%",,50.0

['A)7', 'B)8', 'C)10', 'D)11', 'E)12']",11,"Let's first find the rate at which each painter works.   Mr. Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so his rate is 1 house per 6 days, which is $\frac{1}{6}$ houses per day.  Mr. Black can paint a house in 8 days, so his rate is 1 house per 8 days, which is $\frac{1}{8}$ houses per day.  Mr. Blue can paint a house in 12 days, so his rate is 1 house per 12 days, which is $\frac{1}{12}$ houses per day.  Let's denote the total work as 1 house.   After 8 days, Mr. Brown has completed $\frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3}$ of the work.  After Mr. Brown leaves, Mr. Black works for 6 more days. In these 6 days, Mr. Black completes $6 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{4}$ of the work.  So, the total work completed is $\frac{4}{3} + \frac{3}{4} = \frac{16}{12} + \frac{9}{12} = \frac{25}{12}$.  This means that $\frac{25}{12}$ of the work has been completed after 14 days.   Now, Mr. Blue needs to complete the remaining work, which is $1 - \frac{25}{12} = \frac{12}{12} - \frac{25}{12} = \frac{-13}{12}$ of the work.

Since the hollow cube has a size of 5cm along each edge, the total number of small cubes that make up the hollow cube is 5 * 5 * 5 = 125.  The number of faces of the small cubes that are on the outer surface of the hollow cube is given by the formula 6 * (n - 2)^2, where n is the number of small cubes along one edge of the inner cube. In this case, n = 3, so the number of faces on the outer surface is 6 * (3 - 2)^2 = 6.  Therefore, the number of faces of the small cubes that remain unpainted is 125 * 6 - 6 = 744.  # 744",,744.0

Therefore, the length of line segment ST can be expressed as SU + UT, which is 2x.  We are given that the length of line segment RT is 17. Since SU + UR = 17, and SU = x, we can express UR as 17 - x.  Now, we know that the length of line segment RS is 5. Since RS = RU + US, and US = x, we can express RU as 5 - x.  Since U is the midpoint of ST, we have SU = UT = x. Therefore, we can express RU as RU = RS - SU, which is 5 - x.  Now, we have two expressions for RU: 1. RU = 17 - x 2.

"Boomtown urban planners expect the city’s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? ['A)20%', 'B)40%', 'C)50%', 'D)65%', 'E)75%']",65%,"Let's denote the current population of Boomtown as $P$.   According to the information given, the population of Boomtown one year ago was $P/(1+0.10) = P/1.10$.  The population of Boomtown two years from now is expected to be double the population of one year ago, so it will be $2 \times \left(\frac{P}{1.10}\right)$.  Therefore, the population of Boomtown two years from now is $2 \times \left(\frac{P}{1.10}\right) = \frac{2P}{1.10}$.  Since this population is expected to be the population two years from now, we can set it equal to the population two years from now if there was no growth, which is $P \times (1+0.10)^2 = P \times 1.10^2$.  So, we have $\frac{2P}{1.10} = P \times 1.10^2$.  Solving for $P$, we get $P = \frac{1.10^2}{2} \approx 0.605P$.  Therefore, the population increase over the last year is approximately $0.605P - P = -0.395P$.  To find the percent population increase over the last year, we calculate $\frac{-0.395P}{P} \times 100\% = -39.5\%$.  Therefore, the closest answer choice is $\boxed{\text{B) 40\%}}$.   #-39.5%",,-39.5

Train A starts at 11 am and Train B starts at 2 pm, so Train B starts 3 hours after Train A.  Let $t$ be the time it takes for Train B to meet Train A after Train B starts its journey.  Distance covered by Train A in $t$ hours = $40t$ km  Distance covered by Train B in $t$ hours = $72(t-3)$ km  Since both trains meet each other, the sum of the distances covered by both trains should be equal to the total distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow.  Therefore, $40t + 72(t-3) = 0$  Solving the above equation, we get $t = 9$ hours.  Now, Train B starts at 2 pm and it takes 9 hours to meet Train A. So, they will meet at 11 pm on the same day.

According to the second statement, if Mark gives John one third of his money, John will have $x + \frac{x}{3} = \frac{4x}{3} = 75$. Substituting $x = 50$, we get $\frac{4 \times 50}{3} = \frac{200}{3} = 66.\overline{6}$.  Therefore, John had Rs. 66.\overline{6}, which is closest to Rs. 66.

Now, let's find the number of employees who take a summer vacation: - Total employees taking a summer vacation = Total employees - Employees taking neither vacation - Total employees taking a summer vacation = 100 - 20 = 80 employees.  To find the number of employees who take both winter and summer vacations, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion: - Total employees taking both vacations = Employees taking winter vacation + Employees taking summer vacation - Employees taking neither vacation - Total employees taking both vacations = 40 + 80 - 100 = 20 employees.  Now, let's find the number of employees who take only a summer vacation: - Employees taking only summer vacation = Total employees taking summer vacation - Employees taking both vacations - Employees taking only summer vacation = 80 - 20 = 60 employees.  Finally, let's calculate the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation: - Percentage of employees taking only summer vacation = (Employees taking only summer vacation / Total employees) * 100 - Percentage of employees taking only summer vacation = (60 / 100) * 100 = 60%  Therefore, the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is 60%, which corresponds to option E) 45%.   # E) 45%",,45.0

Given that the diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin, the total amount earned from the dive can be expressed as $0.20x + 0.25y = 3.40$.  Since the total number of coins brought up is $x + y$, we know that $x + y = \text{total number of coins}$.  We are looking to minimize the number of copper coins, so we want to minimize $x$.  To solve this problem, we can substitute $y = \text{total number of coins} - x$ into the equation $0.20x + 0.25y = 3.40$:  $0.20x + 0.25(\text{total number of coins} - x) = 3.40$  $0.20x + 0.25\text{total number of coins} - 0.25x = 3.40$  $0.05x = 3.40 - 0.25\text{total number of coins}$  $x = \frac{3.40 - 0.25\text{total number of coins}}{0.05}$  Since $x$ must be a whole number, we need to find the smallest integer value of $x$ that satisfies this equation.  We know that the total number of coins must be a positive integer, so let's start by trying the smallest possible value for the total number of coins, which is 1.  If the total number of coins is 1, then $x = \frac{3.40 - 0.25(1)}{0.05} = \frac{3.15}{0.05} = 63$, which is not a valid solution since $x$ must be less than or equal to the total number of coins.  Next, let's try the total number of coins as 2:  If the total number of coins is 2, then $x = \frac{3.40 - 0.25(2)}{0.05} = \frac{3.15}{0.05} = 63$, which is not a valid solution since $x$ must be less than or equal to the total number of coins.  Finally, let's try the total number of coins as 3:  If the total number of coins is 3, then $x = \frac{3.40 - 0.25(3)}{0.05} = \frac{3.15}{0.05} = 63$, which is not a valid solution since $x$ must be less than or equal to the total number of coins.

The distance covered by train M is \(4x\) (since it travels for 4 hours) and the distance covered by train N is \((t - 2)y\) (since it travels for \(t - 2\) hours).  Since the distances covered by both trains are the same when they meet, we have the equation:  \[4x = (t - 2)y\]  We also know that the total distance between City A and City B is the sum of the distances covered by both trains, so we have:  \[4x + 2y = 2D\]  where \(D\) is the total distance between City A and City B.

Now, we can substitute this back into the first equation:  \[4x = (t - 2)y\]  \[4x = (t - 2)\left(\frac{4x}{2}\right)\]  \[4x = 2(t - 2)x\]  \[2 = t - 2\]  \[t = 4\]  So, the trains meet 4 hours after train M leaves City A, which is at 9 am.

This means that the number of students surveyed times the number of ways to choose 2 songs must equal the total number of selections of 2 songs: $n \times 45 = 50$.  Solving for $n$: $n = \frac{50}{45} = \frac{10}{9} = 1.\overline{1}$  Since the number of students must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, which gives us $n = 2$.

Speed = Distance / Time  120 miles per hour = Length of the train / 3 seconds  Length of the train = 120 miles per hour * 3 seconds  Now, we can convert the length of the train from miles to feet (1 mile = 5280 feet) to match the units with the length of the tunnel.  Length of the train = 120 miles per hour * 3 seconds * 5280 feet per mile  Next, we need to calculate the total distance the train needs to travel to pass completely through the tunnel, which is the sum of the length of the train and the length of the tunnel.

So, [x] = n if n ≤ x < n+1 for some integer n. 2. [y] = m if m ≤ y < m+1 for some integer m. 3. [x + y] = n + m if n + m ≤ x + y < n + m + 1.  Therefore, L(x,y) = n + m + n + m + n + m = 3n + 3m. Similarly, R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y] = 2n + 2m.  Now, we need to compare the values of L(x,y) and R(x,y) for any positive real numbers x and y.  Let's consider the case where x = 1 and y = 1: [x] = [1] = 1 [y] = [1] = 1 [x + y] = [1 + 1] = [2] = 2 Therefore, L(1,1) = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.

We are also given that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. This means that the number of files not infected by a virus is $0.5 \times 250 = 125$.  Since the number of files infected by a virus is $V + B$, the number of files not infected by a virus is $250 - (V + B)$.  Therefore, we have: $250 - (V + B) = 125$  Now, we know that the number of files infected only by a worm is $W - B = 2.5B$.  Since all files are either infected by a virus or a worm or both, we have: $V + W - B = 250$  We also know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, so: $V = 125 - B$  Substitute $V = 125 - B$ into $V + W - B = 250$: $125 - B + W - B = 250$  Simplify: $W - 2B = 125$  Now, we have two equations: $125 - B + W - B = 250$ $W - 2B = 125$  Solving these two equations simultaneously will give us the values of $W$ and $B$.

The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula:   \[ V = \pi r^2 h \]  where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height (thickness) of the cylinder. Given that the diameter of the coin is 15 mm, the radius is \( \frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \) mm and the height is 2 mm.   Therefore, the volume of the coin is:  \[ V_{\text{coin}} = \pi \times (7.5)^2 \times 2 \]  Next, since the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, the volume of aluminum in the coin is half of the total volume of the coin.   \[ V_{\text{aluminum}} = \frac{1}{2} \times V_{\text{coin}} \]  Given that the weight of the coin is 30 grams, we can find the weight of the aluminum in the coin using the density of aluminum.

If Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours, then in 1 hour he completes 1/12 of the work.  On the particular day, Jack finishes two-thirds of the work. This means he completes 2/3 of the work by himself. Let's find out how long it takes Jack to complete this portion of the work:  Time taken by Jack to complete 2/3 of the work = (2/3) / (1/12) = (2/3) * 12 = 8 hours.  This means Jack took 8 hours to complete two-thirds of the work. The remaining one-third of the work is done by Jill.  Given that Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, it means Jill can clean 5% of what Jack can clean in the same amount of time. Therefore, Jill's rate is 5/100 = 1/20 of Jack's rate.  Let's denote the time taken by Jill to complete the remaining one-third of the work as x hours. In x hours, Jill completes 1/20 of the work.  Now, let's set up the equation based on the work done by Jill:  Jill's work = (1/20) * x = 1/3 (since she completes the remaining one-third of the work).

Plugging in the values, we get:  \[ P(X = 4) = \binom{5}{4} \times 0.9^4 \times (1-0.9)^{5-4} \] \[ P(X = 4) = 5 \times 0.9^4 \times 0.1 \]  Calculating this gives us:  \[ P(X = 4) = 5 \times 0.6561 \times 0.1 \] \[ P(X = 4) = 0.32805 \]  Therefore, the approximate likelihood that exactly four out of five registered voters voted in the last election is 32.8%, which corresponds to answer choice B.   # B) 32.8%",,32.8
"Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need? ['A)58', 'B)62', 'C)66', 'D)70', 'E)74']",58,"Let the length of the yard be \( l \) meters and the width be \( w \) meters. Since the area of the yard is 240 square meters, we have the equation:  \[ l \times w = 240 \]  We are also given that one side of the yard is 10 meters and Alice wants to fence the other three sides. Therefore, the total length of fencing needed is:  \[ 2l + w \]  We can rewrite this in terms of \( w \) using the area equation:  \[ 2\left(\frac{240}{w}\right) + w = 10 + 2w \]  Solving for \( w \) gives:  \[ 480/w + w = 10 + 2w \] \[ 480 + w^2 = 10w + 2w^2 \] \[ w^2 - 10w + 480 = 0 \]  This is a quadratic equation that can be factored as:  \[ (w - 8)(w - 60) = 0 \]  Therefore, \( w = 8 \) or \( w = 60 \). Since the width cannot be greater than the length, we choose \( w = 8 \) meters.  Substitute \( w = 8 \) back into the area equation to find the length:  \[ l = \frac{240}{w} = \frac{240}{8} = 30 \]  Therefore, the length of the yard is 30 meters and the width is 8 meters. The total length of fencing needed is:  \[ 2l + w = 2(30) + 8 = 60 + 8 = 68 \]  So, Alice needs 68 meters of fencing.  # Answer  68",,68.0

Since the store makes a 20% profit on each bag of ice, the selling price is 120% of the cost price.  Let the cost price of one bag of ice be $x. Then, the selling price is 1.2x.  Given that the selling price is $1.25, we have:  1.2x = 1.25  Solving for x:  x = 1.25 / 1.2 x = 1.041666...  So, the cost price of one bag of ice is approximately $1.04.
