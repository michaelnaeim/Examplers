"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower.

After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? ['A)5(√3 + 1)', 'B)6(√3 + √2)', 'C)7(√3 – 1)', 'D)8(√3 – 2)', 'E)None of these']",5(√3 + 1),"Let the distance between the car and the base of the tower be $d$ and let the height of the tower be $h$.   When the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60°, the car has traveled a horizontal distance $x$ such that $\tan(60^\circ) = \frac{h}{d+x}$ and $\tan(45^\circ) = \frac{h}{d}$.   Solving these equations, we get $d = h(\sqrt{3}-1)$ and $x = h$.   Therefore, the total distance the car needs to travel to reach the base of the tower is $d+x = h(\sqrt{3}-1) + h = h(\sqrt{3} + 1)$.  The time taken to cover this distance will be the same as the time taken to cover the distance $h$ at the uniform speed.   Since the car has already traveled for 10 minutes, it will take another $\frac{h}{\text{speed}}$ minutes to reach the base of the tower.  Therefore, the total time taken will be $10 + \frac{h}{\text{speed}}$ minutes.  Hence, the answer is $\boxed{A) 5(\sqrt{3} + 1)}$.   #",,1.0

Given that: - $\frac{1}{16}x$ students study math, - $\frac{1}{10}x$ students study bio, - $\frac{1}{8}x$ students study English.  To find the minimum number of students, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 16, 10, and 8, which is 80. This means the total number of students $x$ must be a multiple of 80.  The minimum number of students is when $x = 80$, and the number of students studying each subject is: - Math: $\frac{1}{16} \times 80 = 5$ students, - Bio: $\frac{1}{10} \times 80 = 8$ students, - English: $\frac{1}{8} \times 80 = 10$ students.  So, the minimum number of students is $80 + 5 + 8 + 10 = 103$.  To find the maximum number of students, we need to find the highest common factor (HCF) of 16, 10, and 8, which is 2.

The maximum number of students is when $x = 9998$ (the largest 4-digit number divisible by 2), and the number of students studying each subject is: - Math: $\frac{1}{16} \times 9998 = 624.875$ students (round up to 625), - Bio: $\frac{1}{10} \times 9998 = 999.8$ students (round down to 999), - English: $\frac{1}{8} \times 9998 = 1249.75$ students (round up to 1250).  So, the maximum number of students is $9998 + 625 + 999 + 1250 = 12872$.  The difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is $12872 - 103 = 12769$.  # Answer  12769",,12769.0

On a normal day, Bill's speed is 15 mph. On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph, so his speed on a windy day is 15 mph - 4 mph = 11 mph.  Next, we need to convert 21 minutes to hours because Bill's speed is given in miles per hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 21 minutes is equal to 21/60 = 0.35 hours.  Now, we can calculate the distance Bill can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes using the formula: distance = speed * time.  distance = 11 mph * 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles.  Therefore, Bill can travel 3.85 miles on a windy day in 21 minutes.  # 3.85 miles",,3.85

['A)20%', 'B)30%', 'C)40%', 'D)50%', 'E)60%']",30%,"Let's denote the following: - Let $C$ be the set of students who are members of the chess club. - Let $S$ be the set of students who are members of the swim team. - Let $D$ be the set of all students at Daifu university.  We are given that $|C \cap S| = 24\%$ of all students, which means $|C \cap S| = 0.24|D|$.  We are also given that $|S - C| = 20\%$ of the swim team members are not members of the chess club. This implies that $|S - C| = 0.20|S|$.  We know that $|C \cap S| + |C - S| + |S - C| = |C \cup S| = |C| + |S| - |C \cap S|$. Substituting the given values, we get: $0.24|D| + |C - S| + 0.20|S| = |C| + |S| - 0.24|D|$.  Since $|C - S| = |C| - |C \cap S|$ and $|C| = |C \cap S| + |C - S|$, we can rewrite the equation as: $0.24|D| + |C| - |C \cap S| + 0.20|S| = |C \cap S| + |C - S| + |S| - 0.24|D|$.  Simplifying further, we get: $0.24|D| + |C| + 0.20|S| = |C \cap S| + |C - S| + |S|$.  Substitute the values we know: $0.24|D| + |C| + 0.20|S| = 0.24|D| + |S|$.  Rearranging the terms, we get: $|C| = 0.04|D| + 0.80|S|$.  This equation tells us that the number of students in the chess club is 4% of all students plus 80% of the students in the swim team.  To find the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team, we need to calculate $\frac{|S|}{|D|}$. We know that $|S| = |C \cap S| + |S - C|$, which is $0.24|D| + 0.20|S|$.   Substitute the equation we derived earlier: $|S| = 0.24|D| + 0.20(0.04|D| + 0.80|S|)$.  Solving for $|S|$, we get: $|S| = 0.24|D| + 0.008|D| + 0.16|S|$.  Rearranging the terms, we get: $0.84|S| = 0.248|D|$.  Therefore, $\frac{|S|}{|D|} = \frac{0.248}{0.84} = 0.2952$ or 29.52%.  # 29.52%",,29.52

Mr. Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so his rate is 1 house per 6 days, which is 1/6 houses per day. Mr. Black can paint a house in 8 days, so his rate is 1 house per 8 days, which is 1/8 houses per day. Mr. Blue can paint a house in 12 days, so his rate is 1 house per 12 days, which is 1/12 houses per day.  Let's denote the total work as 1 house.   After 8 days, Mr. Brown has completed 8*(1/6) = 4/6 = 2/3 of the work. So, 1 - 2/3 = 1/3 of the work is left to be completed.  Now, Mr. Black works for 6 days. In these 6 days, Mr. Black completes 6*(1/8) = 3/4 of the work (since his rate is 1/8 houses per day). Combined with the work done by Mr. Brown, the total work completed is 2/3 + 3/4 = 8/12 + 9/12 = 17/12.  Therefore, 1 - 17/12 = 12/12 - 17/12 = -5/12 of the work is left to be completed by Mr. Blue.

The hollow cube has a size of 5cm and a thickness of 1cm. This means the inner cube has a size of 5cm - 2*1cm = 3cm. Therefore, the number of small cubes along one edge of the inner cube is 3.  Since the inner cube has 3 small cubes along each edge, the total number of small cubes that make up the inner cube is 3 * 3 * 3 = 27.  Now, let's find the total number of small cubes that make up the hollow cube. Since the hollow cube has a size of 5cm along each edge, the number of small cubes along one edge of the hollow cube is 5. Therefore, the total number of small cubes that make up the hollow cube is 5 * 5 * 5 = 125.  The number of faces of the small cubes that are on the outer surface of the hollow cube is given by the formula 6 * (n^2 - (n-2)^2), where n is the size of the hollow cube and (n-2) is the size of the inner cube.

From the information given, we know that 1 gram of the health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.   Therefore, for vitamin E, we have the equation: $0.09 \times 1 = 0.09$ grams of vitamin E in 1 gram of health food.  Similarly, for vitamin A, we have the equation: $0.08 \times 1 = 0.08$ grams of vitamin A in 1 gram of health food.  To find out how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to solve the following system of inequalities: $0.09x \geq E$ $0.08x \geq A$  where $x$ is the number of grams of health food to be eaten daily.  Since we want to satisfy both conditions, we need to find the maximum value of $x$ that satisfies both inequalities.  From the first inequality, we have: $x \geq \frac{E}{0.09}$  From the second inequality, we have: $x \geq \frac{A}{0.08}$  To satisfy both inequalities, we need to take the larger of the two values: $x \geq \max\left(\frac{E}{0.09}, \frac{A}{0.08}\right)$  Substitute the values of $E$ and $A$ to find the minimum value of $x$.  # $\max\left(\frac{E}{0.09}, \frac{A}{0.08}\right) = \max\left(\frac{1}{0.09}, \frac{1}{0.08}\right) = \max\left(11.\overline{1}, 12.5\right) = 12.5$  Therefore, at least 12.5 grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins.  # Answer # 12.5",,12.5

Since the man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes, he will catch the first train if it arrives before the other train.  The probability of the man catching the first train is the probability that the main line train arrives first, which is the probability of a 2-minute interval occurring between the two trains.

The radius of the circle traced out by the point is 10 centimeters. Therefore, the circumference of the circle is given by:  circumference = 2 * π * radius circumference = 2 * π * 10 circumference = 20π centimeters  Now, we need to find the total number of revolutions the fan blade makes in 30 seconds. The fan runs at a rate of 300 revolutions per minute, so in 1 second, it completes 300/60 = 5 revolutions.  Therefore, in 30 seconds, the fan blade completes: 5 revolutions/second * 30 seconds = 150 revolutions  Finally, the total distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade is given by: total distance = circumference * total number of revolutions total distance = 20π * 150 total distance = 3000π  # 3000π",,3000.0

From the information given, we know that the space shuttle can travel 700 meters in 40 seconds at its maximum speed. This gives us the equation:  $700 = 40v$  Solving for $v$:  $v = \frac{700}{40} = 17.5$ meters per second  We are also given that the space shuttle takes 5 seconds to pass a point. During this time, the space shuttle will travel a distance equal to its length $L$:  $L = 5v$  Substitute the value of $v$:  $L = 5 \times 17.5 = 87.5$ meters  Therefore, the length of the space shuttle is 87.5 meters.  # $87.5$ m",,87.5

However, we are interested in finding the minimum number of copper coins brought, so we need to minimize $x$.  To minimize $x$, we need to maximize $y$. Since the diver can only bring a whole number of coins, the maximum value of $y$ is the maximum number of brass coins she can bring while still satisfying the total amount earned.

Since she can only bring a whole number of coins, the maximum number of brass coins she can bring is 13.  Now, we can substitute $y = 13$ back into the equation $0.20x + 0.25y = 3.40$ to find the corresponding value of $x$.  $0.20x + 0.25(13) = 3.40$  $0.20x + 3.25 = 3.40$  $0.20x = 0.15$  $x = 0.15 / 0.20$  $x = 0.75$  Since the number of coins must be a whole number, the minimum number of copper coins she brought is 1.

The time taken by train M to travel from City A to City B is 4 hours, and the time taken by train N to travel from City B to City A is 3.5 hours.  We know that distance = speed $\times$ time.   For train M: \(4x = d\), where \(d\) is the distance between City A and City B.  For train N: \(3.5y = d\).  When the two trains meet, the sum of the distances covered by both trains will be equal to the distance between the two cities.  So, at the time of crossing, we have \(4x + 3.5y = d\).  Now, we need to find the time at which the two trains cross each other. Let's assume that they cross each other \(t\) hours after train M leaves City A.   At that time, train M would have traveled \(xt\) distance and train N would have traveled \(yt\) distance.  Since the sum of the distances covered by both trains is equal to the distance between the two cities, we have:  \(xt + yt = d\).  Substitute the values of \(d\) from the equations above:  \(4x + 3.5y = xt + yt\).  Solving for \(t\):  \(4x + 3.5y = t(x + y)\).  \(t = \frac{4x + 3.5y}{x + y}\).

Since 10% of the pens are defective, the company can only sell 90% of the produced pens. So, the number of pens the company actually sells is \( 0.9 \times 7200 = 6480 \) pens.  The company estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. This means the profit is 25% of the revenue from selling the pens.

To reach the 2nd step, there are two ways (by taking two steps at once or by taking one step twice). For i >= 3, the number of ways to reach the ith step is the sum of the number of ways to reach the (i-1)th step and the number of ways to reach the (i-2)th step. This is because the boy can either take one step from the (i-1)th step or two steps from the (i-2)th step to reach the ith step.  Therefore, we have the following recurrence relation: F(i) = F(i-1) + F(i-2)  Using this relation, we can calculate the number of ways to reach the 10th step by iteratively computing F(i) for i = 3, 4, ..., 10.

This means he completes 2/3 of the work by himself. Let's calculate the fraction of work he completes in 1 hour: (2/3) / 12 = 1/18 of the work per hour.  Now, we are told that Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. Since Jack can complete 1/18 of the work per hour, Jill can complete 5% of that, which is (5/100) * (1/18) = 1/360 of the work per hour.  Let's denote the time it takes Jill to finish the remaining work as x hours. In x hours, Jill completes x * (1/360) = 1/360 of the work.  Since Jack completed 2/3 of the work, the remaining portion that Jill needs to complete is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3 of the work.  Setting up the equation for the remaining work: 1/3 = x * (1/360)  Solving for x: x = (1/3) / (1/360) x = (1/3) * (360/1) x = 120  Therefore, it takes Jill 120 hours to finish the remaining work.  # Answer # 120",,120.0
