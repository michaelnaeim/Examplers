"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower.

When the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60°, the car travels a horizontal distance \(x\) given by: \[x = d \cdot \tan(60^\circ) - d \cdot \tan(45^\circ)\] \[x = d \cdot \sqrt{3} - d \cdot 1 = d(\sqrt{3} - 1)\]  Since the car is moving at a uniform speed, the ratio of horizontal distance to time is constant. Therefore, the car will take the same amount of time to travel the remaining distance to the base of the tower.  The remaining horizontal distance to the base of the tower is \(d - x = d - d(\sqrt{3} - 1) = d(2 - \sqrt{3})\).  To find the time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower, we need to find the ratio of the remaining distance to the speed of the car. Since the speed is constant, this ratio will be the same as the ratio of the distance traveled in the first 10 minutes to the speed of the car.  This ratio is given by: \[\frac{d(2 - \sqrt{3})}{d(\sqrt{3} - 1)} = \frac{10}{t}\] Solving for \(t\): \[t = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} - 1)}{2 - \sqrt{3}} = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} - 1)}{2 - \sqrt{3}} \times \frac{2 + \sqrt{3}}{2 + \sqrt{3}} = \frac{10(2\sqrt{3} - 2 + 3 - 1)}{4 - 3} = \frac{10(2\sqrt{3} - 1)}{1} = 20\sqrt{3} - 10\]  Therefore, the car will take \(20\sqrt{3} - 10\) minutes to reach the base of the tower.  # \(20\sqrt{3} - 10\)",,10.0

We are given that 24% of all students are members of both the chess club and the swim team. This means \( |C \cap S| = 0.24|D| \).  We are also given that 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club. This means \( |S \setminus C| = 0.20|S| \).  We know that \( |C \cap S| + |C \setminus S| = |C| \) and \( |C \cap S| + |S \setminus C| = |S| \).  Substitute the given values into the equations: - \( 0.24|D| + |C \setminus S| = |C| \) - \( 0.24|D| + 0.20|S| = |S| \)  Since \( |C| = 0.24|D| + |C \setminus S| \) and \( |S| = 0.24|D| + 0.20|S| \), we can rewrite the equations as: - \( |C| = 0.24|D| + |C \setminus S| \) - \( |S| = 0.24|D| + 0.20|S| \)  Now, we need to find the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team: - Percentage of students in the swim team: \( \frac{|S|}{|D|} = \frac{0.24|D| + 0.20|S|}{|D|} = 0.24 + 0.20\frac{|S|}{|D|} \)  Since \( \frac{|S|}{|D|} \) represents the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team, we can denote this as \( x \).  Therefore, we have the equation: \[ x = 0.24 + 0.20x \]  Solving for \( x \): \[ 0.80x = 0.24 \] \[ x = \frac{0.24}{0.80} \] \[ x = 0.30 \]  Therefore, 30% of all Daifu students are members of the swim team.  # Answer # 30%",,30.0

Mr. Blue can paint a house in 12 days, so his rate is 1 house per 12 days, which is 1/12 houses per day.  Let's denote the total work as 1 house.   In the first 8 days, Mr. Brown works and completes 8*(1/6) = 4/3 of the work. In the next 6 days, Mr. Black works and completes 6*(1/8) = 3/4 of the work.  Together, Mr. Brown and Mr. Black complete 4/3 + 3/4 = 16/12 + 9/12 = 25/12 of the work.  This means that 1 - 25/12 = 12/12 - 25/12 = -13/12 of the work is left to be done by Mr. Blue.  Since Mr. Blue can complete 1/12 of the work in one day, it will take him 12/(-13/12) = -12/13 days to complete the remaining work.

['A)438', 'B)550', 'C)500', 'D)450', 'E)498']",438,"To solve this problem, we first need to find the total number of small cubes that make up the hollow cube.  The hollow cube has dimensions of 5cm x 5cm x 5cm. Since the thickness of the cube is 1cm, the inner cube will have dimensions of 3cm x 3cm x 3cm. Therefore, the number of small cubes that make up the hollow cube is 3 x 3 x 3 = 27.  Now, let's calculate the number of small cubes that have at least one face painted. Since the outer surface of the hollow cube is painted, the small cubes on the outer layer will have at least one face painted. The outer layer consists of 3 x 3 x 6 = 54 small cubes.  Therefore, the number of small cubes that have at least one face painted is 54.  Finally, the number of small cubes that remain unpainted is the total number of small cubes minus the number of small cubes that have at least one face painted.  Number of small cubes that remain unpainted = 27 - 54 = -27  Since the number of small cubes cannot be negative, it means there was an error in the calculations. Let's correct it.  The outer layer of the hollow cube consists of 3 x 3 x 6 = 54 small cubes. However, the small cubes on the edges are counted twice in this calculation. There are 4 edges with 3 small cubes each, so a total of 4 x 3 = 12 small cubes are counted twice.  Therefore, the correct number of small cubes that have at least one face painted is 54 - 12 = 42.  Now, let's calculate the number of small cubes that remain unpainted.  Number of small cubes that remain unpainted = 27 - 42 = -15  Again, the number of small cubes cannot be negative. Let's correct the calculation.  The small cubes on the edges are counted twice, but the small cubes on the corners are counted thrice. There are 8 corners with 1 small cube each, so a total of 8 small cubes are counted thrice.  Therefore, the correct number of small cubes that have at least one face painted is 42 - 12 + 8 = 38.  Now, let's calculate the number of small cubes that remain unpainted.  Number of small cubes that remain unpainted = 27 - 38 = 11  Therefore, the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is 11 x 6 = 66.  # 66",,66.0

The formula for the area of a circle is given by: \[ A = \pi r^2 \]  Given that the radius of the circle is 14 feet, the area the cow can graze in one day is: \[ A = \pi \times 14^2 = 196\pi \text{ sq.ft.} \]  Since the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, the time taken by the cow to graze the whole field is: \[ \text{Time taken} = \frac{\text{Total area of the field}}{\text{Area grazed per day}} = \frac{\pi \times 14^2}{10} \]  Calculating this value gives: \[ \text{Time taken} = \frac{196\pi}{10} \approx 61 \text{ days} \]  Therefore, the cow will take approximately 61 days to graze the whole field.  #61 days",,61.0

Now, if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75, we can calculate the profit or loss percentage as follows: Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price Profit = 25.75 - 25 Profit = 0.75  To find the percentage profit or loss, we use the formula: Percentage Profit or Loss = (Profit or Loss / Cost Price) * 100  Substitute the values: Percentage Profit or Loss = (0.75 / 25) * 100 Percentage Profit or Loss = 3%  Therefore, if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75, the percentage of profit would have been 3%.   # 3% Profit",,3.0

According to the given information, we have the equation:  \[ \frac{96}{x} = \frac{96}{x-4} + 4 \]  To solve this equation, we can first cross multiply to get rid of the fractions:  \[ 96(x-4) = 96x + 4x(x-4) \]  Simplify the equation:  \[ 96x - 384 = 96x + 4x^2 - 16x \]  Combine like terms:  \[ 0 = 4x^2 - 16x + 384 \]  Divide by 4 to simplify:  \[ 0 = x^2 - 4x + 96 \]  Now, we need to solve this quadratic equation.

"Everyone in the family earns money each month. If the total income of a family per month is $9000 and the median income is $3000, how many members are there in the family?

Given that the median income is $3000, we have $x_3 = 3000$.  The total income of the family is $9000$, so we have $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 9000$.  Since $x_3 = 3000$, the above equation simplifies to $x_1 + x_2 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 6000$.  Since $x_1 \leq x_2 \leq x_3 = 3000 \leq x_4 \leq x_5 \leq x_6$, the minimum value for $x_1$ is $0$ (if all other incomes are equal to $3000$).  Therefore, the maximum value for $x_1$ is $3000$ (if all other incomes are equal to $3000$).  If $x_1 = 3000$, then $x_2 = 0$ and $x_4 = x_5 = x_6 = 0$, which is not possible as all incomes are positive.  Therefore, $x_1 < 3000$.  Let's consider the case where $x_1 = 0$.  If $x_1 = 0$, then $x_2 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 6000$.  Since $x_2 \leq x_4 \leq x_5 \leq x_6$, the maximum value for $x_2$ is $1500$ (if $x_4 = x_5 = x_6 = 1500$).  Therefore, $x_2 < 1500$.  Let's consider the case where $x_2 = 0$.  If $x_2 = 0$, then $x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 6000$.  Since $x_4 \leq x_5 \leq x_6$, the maximum value for $x_4$ is $2000$ (if $x_5 = x_6 = 2000$).  Therefore, $x_4 < 2000$.  Let's consider the case where $x_4 = 0$.  If $x_4 = 0$, then $x_5 + x_6 = 6000$.  Since $x_5 \leq x_6$, the maximum value for $x_5$ is $3000$ (if $x_6 = 3000$).  Therefore, $x_5 < 3000$.  Since $x_1 < 3000$, $x_2 < 1500$, $x_4 < 2000$, and $x_5 < 3000$, the possible values for $x_1, x_2, x_4, x_5$ are limited.  Let's try to find a combination that satisfies the conditions.  Let's try $x_1 = 2000$, $x_2 = 1000$, $x_4 = 1500$, and $x_5 = 2500$.  Substitute these values into the equation $x_1 + x_2 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 6000$ to find $x_6$.  $2000 + 1000 + 1500 + 2500 + x_6 = 6000$  $x_6 = 6000 - 7000 = 1000$  Therefore, the family members' incomes are $2000, 1000, 3000, 1500, 2500, 1000$.

Train N leaves at 7 am and arrives at 10:30 am, so the travel time is 10.5 - 7 = 3.5 hours.  Since Train N leaves 2 hours after Train M, we need to find out how much time Train M has traveled when Train N starts its journey. This is 4 hours (time taken by Train M) - 2 hours (time Train N leaves after Train M) = 2 hours.  Now, we need to find out how far Train M has traveled in 2 hours. Since Train M takes 4 hours to travel from City A to City B, in 2 hours it would have covered half the distance.  Now, we know that when Train N starts its journey, Train M has traveled half the distance. The remaining half of the distance will be covered by both trains together.

The time taken for both trains to meet is the same. Let this time be T.  Therefore, D/2 = SM * 2 and D/2 = SN * T.  Since the total distance is the same, we have SM * 2 = SN * T.  We also know that Train M travels for 2 hours before Train N starts, so Train M has traveled 2 * SM distance when Train N starts.  Therefore, D/2 = 2 * SM + SN * T.  Since SM * 2 = SN * T, we can substitute this into the equation above to get D/2 = 2 * SM + SM * 2.  Solving this equation, we get D = 6 * SM.  This means that Train M covers the entire distance between City A and City B in 4 hours, so SM = D/4.  Now, we know that Train N takes 3.5 hours to cover the same distance, so SN = D/3.5.

In this case: - \( P = $5,000 \) - \( r = 12\% = 0.12 \) - \( n = 2 \) (compounded semi-annually) - \( t = 1 \) year  Plugging in these values, we get:  \[ A = $5,000 \left(1 + \frac{0.12}{2}\right)^{2 \times 1} \]  \[ A = $5,000 \times (1 + 0.06)^2 \]  \[ A = $5,000 \times (1.06)^2 \]  \[ A = $5,000 \times 1.1236 \]  \[ A = $5,618 \]  To find the amount of interest accrued, we subtract the principal amount from the total amount:  \[ \text{Interest} = $5,618 - $5,000 \]  # $618  Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{B)$618}\).",,618.0

From the first row, we have MAD * BE = MAD. This implies that E must be 1 (since any number multiplied by 1 is itself).  From the second row, we have MAD * RA = MAE. Since E is 1, this simplifies to MAD * RA = MA1. This implies that R must be 0 (since any number multiplied by 0 is 0).  Now, we have:  MAD * B1 = MAD MAD * 01 = MA1  From the second equation, we see that A must be 2 (since 0 multiplied by any number is 0, and 1 multiplied by any number is the number itself).

['A)36 grams', 'B)40 grams', 'C)42 grams', 'D)48 grams', 'E)50 grams']",40 grams,"Let's first find the volume of the coin made of alloy.  The volume of a cylinder (the shape of the coin) is given by the formula: \[ V = \pi r^2 h \] where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height.  Given that the diameter of the coin is 15 mm, the radius is \( \frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \) mm and the height is 2 mm.  So, the volume of the coin made of alloy is: \[ V_{\text{alloy}} = \pi \times (7.5)^2 \times 2 \]  Next, we know that the weight of the coin is 30 grams. Since the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, the weight of aluminum and silver in the coin are equal.  Let the weight of aluminum in the coin be \( x \) grams. Then, the weight of silver in the coin is \( 30 - x \) grams.  Given that silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, we have: \[ 2x = 30 - x \] \[ 3x = 30 \] \[ x = 10 \]  So, the weight of aluminum in the coin is 10 grams, and the weight of silver is 20 grams.  Now, let's find the volume of the coin made of pure aluminum measuring 1 x 30 mm.  The radius of this coin is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) mm and the height is 1 mm.  The volume of the coin made of pure aluminum is: \[ V_{\text{aluminum}} = \pi \times (15)^2 \times 1 \]  Since the weight of aluminum is directly proportional to its volume, the weight of the coin made of pure aluminum is: \[ \text{Weight of aluminum coin} = \frac{V_{\text{alloy}}}{V_{\text{aluminum}}} \times \text{Weight of aluminum in alloy} \] \[ \text{Weight of aluminum coin} = \frac{\pi \times (7.5)^2 \times 2}{\pi \times (15)^2 \times 1} \times 10 \]  Solving this expression gives: \[ \text{Weight of aluminum coin} = \frac{112.5}{225} \times 10 = 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ grams} \]  Therefore, the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum is 50 grams.  # 50 grams",,50.0

Given that the remainders are the same, we have: \[2272 = N \cdot Q_1 + R_1\] \[875 = N \cdot Q_2 + R_2\]  Since the remainders are the same, we have: \[2272 - 875 = N \cdot Q_1 - N \cdot Q_2\] \[1397 = N \cdot (Q_1 - Q_2)\]  Since \(N\) is a 3-digit number, the possible values for \(N\) are between 100 and 999.

We are given that the area of the yard is 240 square meters, so we have the equation: \[ l \times w = 240 \]  We are also given that one side of the yard is 10 meters unfenced. This means that the length of the yard is fenced on three sides, which are \( w, w, \) and \( l \) meters long. The total length of fencing needed is the sum of these three sides: \[ 2w + l = \text{total length of fencing} \]  We are looking for the total length of fencing needed, so we need to find the values of \( l \) and \( w \) first.  Since we have two equations and two unknowns, we can solve for \( l \) and \( w \) by substitution or elimination.  From the first equation, we can express \( l \) in terms of \( w \): \[ l = \frac{240}{w} \]  Substitute this into the second equation: \[ 2w + \frac{240}{w} = \text{total length of fencing} \]  To find the value of \( w \), we can take the derivative of the equation and set it to zero to find the minimum value of the function. However, since this is a multiple-choice question, we can try different values of \( w \) to see which one gives us an area of 240 square meters.
