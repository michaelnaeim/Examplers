"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower.

['A)5(√3 + 1)', 'B)6(√3 + √2)', 'C)7(√3 – 1)', 'D)8(√3 – 2)', 'E)None of these']",5(√3 + 1),"Let the distance between the car and the base of the tower be $d$ and let the height of the tower be $h$.   When the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60°, the car has traveled a horizontal distance $x$ such that $\tan(60^\circ) = \frac{h}{d+x}$ and $\tan(45^\circ) = \frac{h}{x}$.   Solving these two equations, we get $d = x(\sqrt{3} - 1)$.  Since the car is moving at a uniform speed, the time taken to travel a distance $x$ is the same as the time taken to travel a distance $d$.   Given that it took 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°, the time taken to travel a distance $d$ is also 10 minutes.   Therefore, the total time taken for the car to reach the base of the tower is $10 + 10 = 20$ minutes.  # $20$",,20.0

['A)384', 'B)562', 'C)458', 'D)156', 'E)452']",384,"To find the average speed of the plane around the field, we can use the formula:  Average speed = Total distance / Total time  First, let's find the total distance around the square. Since the plane flies along the four sides of a square, the total distance is the perimeter of the square.  Let the side length of the square be 'a'. Then, the perimeter of the square is 4a.  Now, let's find the total time taken to fly around the square. The time taken to fly each side is given by the formula: time = distance / speed.  For the first side: time = a / 200 For the second side: time = a / 400 For the third side: time = a / 600 For the fourth side: time = a / 800  The total time taken to fly around the square is the sum of the times taken to fly each side.  Total time = a/200 + a/400 + a/600 + a/800  Now, we can substitute the total distance (4a) and total time into the formula for average speed:  Average speed = 4a / (a/200 + a/400 + a/600 + a/800)  Simplifying the expression:  Average speed = 4 / (1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800)  Average speed = 4 / (1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800) Average speed = 4 / (8/1200 + 6/1200 + 4/1200 + 3/1200) Average speed = 4 / (21/1200) Average speed = 4800 / 21 Average speed = 228.57 km/hr  Therefore, the average speed of the plane around the field is 228.57 km/hr.  # 228.57",,228.57

We know that Jack buys a total of 18 sharpeners, so we have the equation $x + y = 18$.  We also know that the cost of each white sharpener is 1 rupee more than the cost of each brown sharpener. Therefore, the total cost of the white sharpeners is $x(x+1)$ and the total cost of the brown sharpeners is $y(y-1)$.   Given that the total cost of all sharpeners is 100 rupees, we have the equation $x(x+1) + y(y-1) = 100$.  Now we have a system of two equations: 1. $x + y = 18$ 2. $x(x+1) + y(y-1) = 100$  We can solve this system of equations to find the values of $x$ and $y$.   From the first equation, we can express $y$ in terms of $x$ as $y = 18 - x$.  Substitute this expression for $y$ into the second equation: $x(x+1) + (18-x)(17-x) = 100$ $x^2 + x + 306 - 35x + x^2 = 100$ $2x^2 - 34x + 206 = 0$ $x^2 - 17x + 103 = 0$  Using the quadratic formula, we find: $x = \frac{-(-17) \pm \sqrt{(-17)^2 - 4*1*103}}{2*1}$ $x = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 412}}{2}$ $x = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{123}}{2}$  Since the discriminant is not a perfect square, the values of $x$ will not be integers.

In the next 3 hours, both hoses together fill the remaining $\frac{3}{4}$ of the pool. The combined rate of both hoses is $a + b$, so we have the equation:  $3(a + b) = \frac{3}{4}$  Substitute $a = \frac{1}{8}$ into the equation:  $3(\frac{1}{8} + b) = \frac{3}{4}$  $\frac{3}{8} + 3b = \frac{3}{4}$  $3b = \frac{3}{4} - \frac{3}{8}$  $3b = \frac{6}{8} - \frac{3}{8}$  $3b = \frac{3}{8}$  $b = \frac{1}{8}$  Therefore, hose B can fill the pool alone in $8$ hours.  # Answer  # 8",,8.0

Mr. Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so his rate is 1 house per 6 days, which is 1/6 houses per day. Mr. Black can paint a house in 8 days, so his rate is 1 house per 8 days, which is 1/8 houses per day. Mr. Blue can paint a house in 12 days, so his rate is 1 house per 12 days, which is 1/12 houses per day.  Let's denote the total work as 1 house.   After 8 days, Mr. Brown has completed 8*(1/6) = 4/6 = 2/3 of the work. So, 1 - 2/3 = 1/3 of the work is left to be completed.  Now, Mr. Black works for 6 days. In these 6 days, Mr. Black completes 6*(1/8) = 3/4 of the work. Combined with the work done by Mr. Brown, the total work completed is 2/3 + 3/4 = 8/12 + 9/12 = 17/12.  Therefore, 1 - 17/12 = 12/12 - 17/12 = -5/12 of the work is left to be completed by Mr. Blue.  Since Mr. Blue completes 1/12 of the work per day, it will take him 12/(-5/12) = -12/5 days to complete the remaining work.  However, since time cannot be negative, we made an error in our calculations. Let's reevaluate our steps.  After 8 days, Mr. Brown completes 2/3 of the work, leaving 1/3 of the work remaining. When Mr. Black works for 6 days, he completes 3/4 of the remaining 1/3 of the work, which is 1/4 of the total work. Therefore, the total work completed is 2/3 + 1/4 = 8/12 + 3/12 = 11/12.  Hence, 1 - 11/12 = 12/12 - 11/12 = 1/12 of the work is left to be completed by Mr. Blue.  Since Mr. Blue completes 1/12 of the work per day, it will take him 12/(1/12) = 12*12 = 144 days to complete the remaining work.  # 144",,144.0

['A)438', 'B)550', 'C)500', 'D)450', 'E)498']",438,"To solve this problem, we first need to find the total number of smaller cubes that make up the hollow cube.  The hollow cube has a size of 5cm and a thickness of 1cm. This means the inner cube has a size of 5cm - 2*1cm = 3cm. Therefore, the number of smaller cubes along one edge of the inner cube is 3.  Since the inner cube has 3 smaller cubes along each edge, the total number of smaller cubes that make up the hollow cube is 3^3 = 27.  Now, let's calculate the number of faces of the smaller cubes that are painted when the outer surface of the hollow cube is painted.  The outer surface of the hollow cube consists of the 5x5 faces of the outer cube minus the 3x3 faces of the inner cube. So, there are 5x5 - 3x3 = 25 - 9 = 16 faces of the smaller cubes that are painted.  Each smaller cube has 6 faces, so the total number of faces of the smaller cubes is 27 * 6 = 162.  Therefore, the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is 162 - 16 = 146.  # 146",,146.0

When divided by 10, we get $\frac{5x + 20}{10} = \frac{x + 4}{2}$. We are given that this expression is a perfect square.  Let's express $\frac{x + 4}{2}$ as a perfect square. Let $n$ be the perfect square such that $n^2 = \frac{x + 4}{2}$. Then, we have $x + 4 = 2n^2$.  Since $x$ is a two-digit odd number, $x$ must be odd and between 10 and 98.

Since the order of letters in a pair does not matter, we only need to consider combinations, not permutations. The number of ways to choose 2 letters out of 5 distinct letters is given by the combination formula ${n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of distinct letters and $k$ is the number of letters chosen.  In this case, we have 5 distinct letters, so the number of ways to choose 2 letters out of 5 is ${5 \choose 2} = \frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = 10$.

From the information given, we know that 1 gram of the health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.  Therefore, for vitamin E, we have the equation: $0.09 \times x = E$, where $x$ is the number of grams of the health food needed to meet the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E.  Similarly, for vitamin A, we have the equation: $0.08 \times x = A$, where $x$ is the number of grams of the health food needed to meet the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.  To satisfy both requirements simultaneously, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of $E$ and $A$.   Let's assume $E = 100$ and $A = 125$ (these are arbitrary values for the minimum daily requirements of vitamin E and vitamin A, respectively).  The LCM of 100 and 125 is 500. This means that we need to find the least number of grams of the health food needed to provide at least 500 units of both vitamins.  Now, we can solve for $x$: $0.09 \times x = 100$ $x = \frac{100}{0.09} \approx 1111.11$ grams for vitamin E  $0.08 \times x = 125$ $x = \frac{125}{0.08} = 1562.5$ grams for vitamin A  Since we need to satisfy both requirements, we take the larger value, which is 1562.5 grams.

According to the information given, the population of Boomtown one year ago was $P/(1+0.10) = P/1.10$.  The population of Boomtown two years from now is expected to be double the population of one year ago, so it will be $2 \times \left(\frac{P}{1.10}\right)$.  Therefore, the population of Boomtown two years from now is $2 \times \left(\frac{P}{1.10}\right) = \frac{2P}{1.10}$.  We are given that this population is expected to be double the current population, so we have:  $\frac{2P}{1.10} = 2P$  Solving for $P$:  $2P = 2P \times 1.10$  $2P = 2.20P$  $P = \frac{2P}{2.20}$  $P = \frac{10P}{11}$  This means that the population of Boomtown is expected to increase by $\frac{1}{11}$ or approximately $9.09\%$ over the next year.  To find the percent population increase over the last year, we calculate:  $10\% - 9.09\% = 0.91\%$  Therefore, the closest answer choice is $\boxed{\text{A) 20\%}}$.  # 20%",,20.0

Plugging these values into the formula and solving for $n$, we get: $$n = \frac{-11 \pm \sqrt{11^2 - 4 \times 3 \times -500}}{2 \times 3}$$ $$n = \frac{-11 \pm \sqrt{121 + 600}}{6}$$ $$n = \frac{-11 \pm \sqrt{721}}{6}$$  Since the number of members cannot be negative, we take the positive root: $$n = \frac{-11 + \sqrt{721}}{6}$$  Calculating the value of $n$ gives: $$n \approx 18.45$$  Since the number of members must be a whole number, the number of members in the club is 18.  Therefore, the answer is: # 18",,18.0

In 3 hours, Train A covers a distance of \(40 \, \text{kmph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{km}\).  Now, both trains are moving towards each other. The relative speed at which they are approaching each other is \(40 \, \text{kmph} + 72 \, \text{kmph} = 112 \, \text{kmph}\).  The total distance that needs to be covered is 120 km (the head start distance). The time taken to cover this distance at a relative speed of 112 kmph is:  \[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{120 \, \text{km}}{112 \, \text{kmph}} \approx 1.07 \, \text{hours} \]  So, the two trains will meet 1.07 hours after Train B starts its journey at 2 pm.  Adding this time to 2 pm gives us the time at which the two trains will meet:  \[ 2 \, \text{pm} + 1.07 \, \text{hours} = 3.07 \, \text{pm} \]  Therefore, the two trains will meet at 3:07 pm.  # \(\boxed{C) \text{5 pm on the next day}}\)",,5.0

Substitute $r = \frac{a}{2}$ into the formula to find the volume of the sphere:  $V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3}\pi \left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{4}{3}\pi \left(\frac{a^3}{8}\right) = \frac{\pi a^3}{6}$.  Therefore, the ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the sphere is:  $\frac{V_{\text{cube}}}{V_{\text{sphere}}} = \frac{a^3}{\frac{\pi a^3}{6}} = \frac{6}{\pi}$.  So, the ratio of the volumes of the cube to the sphere is $\boxed{6:\pi}$.   #6:π",,6.0

We know that distance = speed $\times$ time.  For train M: \(d = 4x\)  For train N: \(d = 3.5y\)  Since the distance is the same for both trains, we can set the two expressions equal to each other:  \(4x = 3.5y\)  To find the time when the two trains cross each other, we need to find the time taken by each train to reach the meeting point.  Let \(t\) be the time taken by train M to reach the meeting point. Therefore, the time taken by train N to reach the meeting point would be \(t - 2\) (since train N started 2 hours later).  Distance covered by train M in time \(t\) = \(xt\)  Distance covered by train N in time \(t-2\) = \(y(t-2)\)  Since they meet at the same point, the distances covered by both trains are equal:  \(xt = y(t-2)\)  Now, we have two equations:  1. \(4x = 3.5y\) 2. \(xt = y(t-2)\)  We can solve these two equations to find the values of \(x\) and \(y\), and then find the time \(t\) when they meet.

Let's calculate the values of $x$ for different values of $y$: For $y = 0$: $x = \frac{810 - 30(0)}{70} = \frac{810}{70} = 11.57$ (not a whole number)  For $y = 1$: $x = \frac{810 - 30(1)}{70} = \frac{780}{70} = 11.14$ (not a whole number)  For $y = 2$: $x = \frac{810 - 30(2)}{70} = \frac{750}{70} = 10.71$ (not a whole number)  For $y = 3$: $x = \frac{810 - 30(3)}{70} = \frac{720}{70} = 10.29$ (not a whole number)  For $y = 4$: $x = \frac{810 - 30(4)}{70} = \frac{690}{70} = 9.86$ (not a whole number)  For $y = 5$: $x = \frac{810 - 30(5)}{70} = \frac{660}{70} = 9.43$ (not a whole number)  For $y = 6$: $x = \frac{810 - 30(6)}{70} = \frac{630}{70} = 9$ (whole number)  Therefore, the maximum number of trousers that can be bought is 9 when 6 shirts are also bought.  The ratio of trousers to shirts is $9:6$ which simplifies to $3:2$.  # The ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased is 3:2.",,2.0
"If a subscription for 15 issues of a magazine costs $42.00 and represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices, what is the cover price per issue?

Next, let's calculate the cost per year of repairing the current tires. Since the repair costs $40 per tire and extends the life of the tire by 1 year, the cost per year for repairing the current tires is $40/1 = $40 per year.  To find the percentage increase of the cost of new tires compared to repairing the current tires, we use the formula:  Percentage Increase = ((New Cost - Old Cost) / Old Cost) * 100%  Substitute the values:  Percentage Increase = (($45 - $40) / $40) * 100% Percentage Increase = ($5 / $40) * 100% Percentage Increase = 0.125 * 100% Percentage Increase = 12.5%  Therefore, the average cost per year of the new tires is 12.5% greater than the cost of repairing the current tires.  # 12.5%",,12.5

The company sells each pen for Rs. 10, so the revenue from selling 7200 pens is \( 7200 \times 10 = 72000 \) rupees.  Since 10% of the pens are defective, the company can only sell 90% of the produced pens. So, the number of pens the company actually sells is \( 0.9 \times 7200 = 6480 \) pens.  The company estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. This means the revenue from selling the pens is 125% of the manufacturing cost.  So, we have the equation: \[ 1.25 \times 72000 = 6480 \times x \]  Solving for \( x \): \[ x = \frac{1.25 \times 72000}{6480} = \frac{90000}{6480} = 13.8889 \]  Therefore, the manufactured cost of each pen is approximately Rs. 13.89.  # \(\boxed{13.89}\)",,13.89

"Suppose for any real number x, [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x. Let L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] and R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y].

For $L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y]$, we know that $[x]$ is the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$. This means that $[x] \leq x < [x] + 1$. Similarly, $[y] \leq y < [y] + 1$. Adding these inequalities, we get $[x] + [y] \leq x + y < [x] + [y] + 2$. Therefore, $[x] + [y] \leq x + y < [x] + [y] + 2$.  Now, let's consider $R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]$. Since $[2x]$ is the greatest integer less than or equal to $2x$, we have $[2x] \leq 2x < [2x] + 1$. Similarly, $[2y] \leq 2y < [2y] + 1$. Adding these inequalities, we get $[2x] + [2y] \leq 2x + 2y < [2x] + [2y] + 2$. Therefore, $[2x] + [2y] \leq 2x + 2y < [2x] + [2y] + 2$.  Now, we can compare the ranges of $L(x,y)$ and $R(x,y)$:  $[x] + [y] \leq x + y < [x] + [y] + 2$  $[2x] + [2y] \leq 2x + 2y < [2x] + [2y] + 2$  Since $2x + 2y = 2(x + y)$, we can see that the ranges of $L(x,y)$ and $R(x,y)$ are different. Specifically, the range of $L(x,y)$ is shifted by 2 compared to the range of $R(x,y)$.  Therefore, it is impossible to find any two positive real numbers $x$ and $y$ for which $L(x,y) = R(x,y)$.  # Answer  #E)None",,2.0

We are also given that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. This means that the number of files not infected by a virus is $0.5 \times 250 = 125$.  Since the number of files infected by a virus is $V + B$, the number of files not infected by a virus is $250 - (V + B)$.  Therefore, we have: $250 - (V + B) = 125$  Now, we know that the number of files infected only by a worm is $W - B = 2.5B$.  Since all files are either infected by a virus or a worm or both, we have: $V + W - B = 250$  We also know that $V + B = 125$.  Now, we can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of $V$, $W$, and $B$.  From $V + B = 125$, we have $V = 125 - B$.

At 9:00 am, the dog has eaten $\frac{1}{3}x$ and there is $\frac{2}{3}x$ left in the bowl.  At 10:00 am, the dog has eaten $\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{2}{3}x = \frac{2}{9}x$ and there is $\frac{7}{9}x$ left in the bowl.  At 11:00 am, the dog has eaten $\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{7}{9}x = \frac{7}{27}x$ and there is $\frac{20}{27}x$ left in the bowl.  At 12:00 pm, right before the dog begins to eat, there is $\frac{20}{27}x$ dog food left in the bowl.  To find the percentage of the original food remaining, we calculate $\frac{\frac{20}{27}x}{x} \times 100\%$.  This simplifies to $\frac{20}{27} \times 100\% \approx 74.07\%$.

"John conducted a survey about car color. 60% of the people who took the survey were women. Of the men who were surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars. If 10 men liked green cars more than red, how many people took the survey? ['A)100', 'B)120', 'C)50', 'D)200', 'E)80']",100,"Let's denote the total number of people who took the survey as $T$.   Given that 60% of the people who took the survey were women, the number of women who took the survey is $0.6T$.   Since the remaining 40% are men, the number of men who took the survey is $0.4T$.   We are also given that 75% of the men preferred red cars over green cars. Therefore, the number of men who preferred red cars is $0.75 \times 0.4T = 0.3T$.   Given that 10 men liked green cars more than red, we can set up the equation:   Number of men who liked green cars more than red = Number of men who preferred green cars - Number of men who preferred red cars = 10  Let's denote the number of men who preferred green cars as $x$.   Therefore, $x - 0.3T = 10$  We also know that the total number of men who took the survey is $0.4T$, so we have:   $x + 0.3T = 0.4T$  Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get $x = 0.1T + 10$  Since the total number of people who took the survey is $T$, we have:   $0.6T + 0.4T = T$  $0.6T + 0.4T = T$  $1T = T$  Therefore, the total number of people who took the survey is $T$.   To find the value of $T$, we substitute $x = 0.1T + 10$ into $x + 0.3T = 0.4T$:  $0.1T + 10 + 0.3T = 0.4T$  $0.4T + 10 = 0.4T$  $10 = 0.1T$  $T = 100$  Therefore, the total number of people who took the survey is 100.  #  100",,100.0
"How many ways A boy can reach the top of stairs which contain 10 steps, when he can take either one or two steps every time? ['A)88', 'B)89', 'C)90', 'D)91', 'E)92']",89,"To find the number of ways the boy can reach the top of the stairs, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Let's denote the number of ways to reach step $n$ as $f(n)$.   For the base cases, we have $f(1) = 1$ (he can only take one step to reach the first step) and $f(2) = 2$ (he can either take two steps at once or two steps one at a time).  For any step $n$ where $n > 2$, the number of ways to reach step $n$ is the sum of the number of ways to reach step $n-1$ and step $n-2$. This is because the boy can either take one step from step $n-1$ to reach step $n$ or take two steps from step $n-2$ to reach step $n$.  Therefore, we have the recursive formula: $$f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)$$  Using this formula, we can calculate $f(3)$, $f(4)$, ..., $f(10)$ to find the number of ways to reach the top of the stairs.  $f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 2 + 1 = 3$  $f(4) = f(3) + f(2) = 3 + 2 = 5$  $f(5) = f(4) + f(3) = 5 + 3 = 8$  $f(6) = f(5) + f(4) = 8 + 5 = 13$  $f(7) = f(6) + f(5) = 13 + 8 = 21$  $f(8) = f(7) + f(6) = 21 + 13 = 34$  $f(9) = f(8) + f(7) = 34 + 21 = 55$  $f(10) = f(9) + f(8) = 55 + 34 = 89$  Therefore, the boy can reach the top of the stairs in 89 ways.  #89",,89.0
"IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink? ['A)0.5', 'B)1', 'C)1.25', 'D)1.5', 'E)2']",0.5,"Let's denote the total amount of soft drink needed as \(x\) gallons. Initially, 40% of one gallon of soft drink is orange juice, which means 0.4 gallons of orange juice is in one gallon of soft drink. Since the soft drink is 60% water, 0.6 gallons of water is in one gallon of soft drink.  After adding \(y\) gallons of orange juice, the total amount of orange juice in the mixture will be \(0.4 + y\) gallons. The total amount of soft drink will be \(x + y\) gallons.  According to the question, the orange juice should be 60% of the soft drink. This can be expressed as:  \[\frac{0.4 + y}{x + y} = 0.6\]  Solving this equation will give us the value of \(y\), which represents the additional gallons of orange juice needed.  \[0.4 + y = 0.6(x + y)\] \[0.4 + y = 0.6x + 0.6y\] \[0.4 - 0.6x = 0.6y - y\] \[0.4 - 0.6x = 0.4y\] \[0.4 = 0.4y + 0.6x\] \[0.4 = 2y + 3x\]  Since we know that \(x = 1\) (initially one gallon of soft drink), we can substitute this into the equation:  \[0.4 = 2y + 3(1)\] \[0.4 = 2y + 3\] \[2y = -2.6\] \[y = -1.3\]  Since the amount of additional orange juice cannot be negative, we made an error in our calculations.

"Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need? ['A)58', 'B)62', 'C)66', 'D)70', 'E)74']",58,"Let the length of the yard be \( l \) meters and the width be \( w \) meters. Since the area of the yard is 240 square meters, we have the equation:  \[ l \times w = 240 \]  We are also given that one side of the yard is 10 meters and Alice wants to put up fencing around the other three sides. Therefore, the total length of fencing needed is:  \[ 2l + w \]  We can express \( w \) in terms of \( l \) from the area equation:  \[ w = \frac{240}{l} \]  Substitute this into the expression for the total length of fencing:  \[ 2l + \frac{240}{l} \]  To minimize the amount of fencing needed, we need to find the minimum value of this expression. This can be done using calculus by finding the derivative of the expression with respect to \( l \) and setting it equal to zero:  \[ \frac{d}{dl} (2l + \frac{240}{l}) = 2 - \frac{240}{l^2} = 0 \]  Solving for \( l \) gives:  \[ l^2 = 120 \]  \[ l = \sqrt{120} \]  \[ l = 2\sqrt{30} \]  Substitute this back into the expression for the total length of fencing:  \[ 2(2\sqrt{30}) + \frac{240}{2\sqrt{30}} \]  \[ 4\sqrt{30} + \frac{240}{2\sqrt{30}} \]  \[ 4\sqrt{30} + 4\sqrt{30} \]  \[ 8\sqrt{30} \]  Now, to find the numerical value of the total length of fencing needed, we can calculate:  \[ 8\sqrt{30} \approx 46.57 \]  Therefore, Alice needs approximately 46.57 meters of fencing.  # 47",,47.0
