Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 41 bird families living near the mountain. If 35 bird families flew away to asia and 62 bird families flew away to africa How many more bird families flew away to africa than those that flew away to asia?,27,"To find out how many more bird families flew away to Africa than those that flew away to Asia, we first need to calculate the total number of bird families that flew away to each destination.  Total number of bird families = 41  Number of bird families that flew away to Asia = 35  Number of bird families that flew away to Africa = 62  To find the difference between the number of bird families that flew to Africa and Asia, we subtract the number of bird families that flew to Asia from the number of bird families that flew to Africa.  Difference = Number of bird families that flew to Africa - Number of bird families that flew to Asia  Difference = 62 - 35  Difference = 27  Therefore, 27 more bird families flew away to Africa than those that flew away to Asia.  #27",,27.0

Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Together they collected strawberries that weighed 22 pounds. On the way back Marco ' dad found 30 more pounds of strawberries. Marco's strawberries now weighed 36 pounds. How much did his dad's strawberries weigh now?,16,"Let's denote the weight of the strawberries Marco collected as $x$ pounds and the weight of the strawberries his dad collected as $y$ pounds.  From the information given in the question, we have the following two equations:  1. $x + y = 22$ (the total weight of strawberries collected by Marco and his dad is 22 pounds) 2. $x + 30 = 36$ (after his dad found 30 more pounds of strawberries, Marco's strawberries weighed 36 pounds)  From equation 1, we can express $y$ in terms of $x$ as $y = 22 - x$.  Substitute this expression for $y$ into equation 2:  $x + 30 = 36$  Solving for $x$:  $x = 36 - 30$  $x = 6$  Now, substitute $x = 6$ back into $y = 22 - x$ to find $y$:  $y = 22 - 6$  $y = 16$  Therefore, Marco's dad's strawberries weighed 16 pounds.  # 16",,16.0
Debby bought 200 water bottles and 256 soda bottles when they were on sale.

Since the book has 193 pages and it took Frank 660 days to finish it, we can calculate the average number of pages he read per day by dividing the total number of pages by the total number of days:  Average pages read per day = Total pages / Total days Average pages read per day = 193 pages / 660 days Average pages read per day = 0.292 pages per day  Next, we need to find out how many pages are in each chapter. Since the pages are equally distributed over 15 chapters, we can calculate the number of pages in each chapter by dividing the total number of pages by the number of chapters:  Pages per chapter = Total pages / Total chapters Pages per chapter = 193 pages / 15 chapters Pages per chapter = 12.867 pages  Now, we can find out how many chapters Frank read per day by dividing the average pages read per day by the number of pages in each chapter:  Chapters per day = Average pages read per day / Pages per chapter Chapters per day = 0.292 pages per day / 12.867 pages Chapters per day ≈ 0.0227 chapters per day  Therefore, Frank read approximately 0.0227 chapters per day.  # 0.0227 chapters per day",,0.0227

After adding 2 more action figures, the total number of action figures becomes $x + 2$.  Then, after removing 7 of the old ones, the total number of action figures becomes $(x + 2) - 7$.  Given that there are 10 action figures on the shelf now, we have the equation:  $(x + 2) - 7 = 10$  Solving for $x$:  $x - 5 = 10$  $x = 10 + 5$  $x = 15$  Therefore, Jerry initially had 15 action figures on the shelf.  #15",,15.0
Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 12 cups of flour 5 cups of sugar and 49 cups of salt. She already put in 11 cups of flour. How many more cups of flour does she need to add?,1,"To find out how many more cups of flour Mary needs to add, we need to subtract the amount of flour she has already put in from the total amount required by the recipe.  Total amount of flour required by the recipe = 12 cups Amount of flour Mary has already put in = 11 cups  Therefore, the number of cups of flour Mary still needs to add = Total amount of flour required - Amount of flour already put in = 12 cups - 11 cups = 1 cup  So, Mary needs to add 1 more cup of flour to the cake.  # 1",,1.0
Jake has 8 fewer peaches and 10 more apples than Steven. Steven has 11 apples and 18 peaches. How many more peaches than apples does Steven have?,7,"Let's first find out how many peaches and apples Jake has.  Since Jake has 8 fewer peaches than Steven, Jake has 18 - 8 = 10 peaches.  Since Jake has 10 more apples than Steven, Jake has 11 + 10 = 21 apples.  Now, let's find out how many more peaches than apples Steven has.  Steven has 18 peaches and 11 apples, so he has 18 - 11 = 7 more peaches than apples.  # 7",,7.0
Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar and 10 cups of flour. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar How many cups of flour did she put in?,2,"Let's denote the number of cups of sugar as $s$ and the number of cups of flour she put in as $f$.

Initially, there were 16 roses and 3 orchids in the vase, so the total number of flowers was $16 + 3 = 19$.  After cutting some roses and orchids, there are now 7 orchids and 13 roses in the vase, so the total number of flowers is $7 + 13 = 20$.  Since the total number of flowers remains the same, we can set up the following equation: $16 - x + 13 = 7$ (number of roses) $3 - y + 7 = 13$ (number of orchids)  Solving these equations, we get: $16 - x + 13 = 7$ $-x = -22$ $x = 22$  $3 - y + 7 = 13$ $-y = 3$ $y = -3$  Since the number of orchids cannot be negative, Jessica did not cut any orchids.

Each pack has 14 pencils, and Faye has 6 packs, so the total number of pencils in the packs is: $14 \text{ pencils/pack} \times 6 \text{ packs} = 84$ pencils  Next, we need to add the pencils in the packs to the pencils she placed in rows. Faye placed the pencils in rows with 22 pencils in each row. To find out how many pencils she placed in rows, we multiply the number of pencils in each row by the number of rows: $22 \text{ pencils/row} \times \text{number of rows}$  Since we don't know the number of rows, we can represent it as $x$. Therefore, the total number of pencils Faye has is: $84 \text{ pencils (packs)} + 22x \text{ pencils (rows)}$  To find the total number of pencils, we need to solve for $x$ by setting up an equation. We know that the total number of pencils is the same whether we count them by packs or by rows, so: $84 + 22x = \text{total number of pencils}$  Given that Faye has 6 packs of pencils, we can substitute $84$ into the equation: $84 + 22x = 6 \times 14$  Solving for $x$: $22x = 84$ $x = \frac{84}{22}$ $x = 3$  Now that we know Faye has 3 rows of pencils, we can find the total number of pencils she has: $84 \text{ pencils (packs)} + 22 \text{ pencils/row} \times 3 \text{ rows}$  Calculating the total number of pencils: $84 + 22 \times 3 = 84 + 66 = 150$  Therefore, Faye has 150 pencils in total.  # 150",,150.0
