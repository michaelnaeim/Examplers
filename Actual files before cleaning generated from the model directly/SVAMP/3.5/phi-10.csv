2 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop some more children got on the bus. Then there were 10 children altogether on the bus. How many more children are on the bus now than there were before the bus stop?,8,"Let's denote the number of children on the bus before the bus stop as $x$. After some more children got on the bus, there were 10 children altogether. So, we have the equation $x + \text{additional children} = 10$.  Since we know that initially there were 2 children on the bus, we can rewrite the equation as $2 + \text{additional children} = 10$.  Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us $\text{additional children} = 10 - 2 = 8$.  Therefore, there are 8 more children on the bus now than there were before the bus stop.  # 8",,8
3 birds were sitting on the fence. 2 more birds and 6 more storks came to join them. How many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence?,1,"Let's first find the total number of birds on the fence after the additional birds and storks joined.   Initially, there were 3 birds on the fence. After 2 more birds joined, there are 3 + 2 = 5 birds on the fence.  Then, 6 more storks joined, making the total number of storks on the fence 6.  So, the total number of birds on the fence is 5 and the total number of storks on the fence is 6.  To find how many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence, we subtract the number of birds from the number of storks: 6 - 5 = 1.

Julia played tag with 19 kids on monday. She played tag with 18 kids on tuesday. She spent a total of 38 hours to play tag on both days. How many more kids did she play with on monday than on tuesday?,1,"Let's denote the number of kids Julia played with on Monday as $x$ and the number of kids she played with on Tuesday as $y$.  From the given information, we have the following two equations: 1. $x + y = 19$ (from Monday) 2. $x + y = 18$ (from Tuesday)  We also know that Julia spent a total of 38 hours playing tag on both days. Let's denote the time she spent playing tag with each kid as $a$ hours on Monday and $b$ hours on Tuesday.  So, the total time spent on Monday is $x \cdot a$ hours and the total time spent on Tuesday is $y \cdot b$ hours. We know that the total time spent is 38 hours, so we have the equation: $x \cdot a + y \cdot b = 38$  Since we are looking for the difference in the number of kids she played with on Monday and Tuesday, we need to find $x - y$.  To solve this system of equations, we can subtract the equation for Tuesday from the equation for Monday: $(x + y) - (x + y) = 19 - 18$ $0 = 1$  This means that the system of equations is inconsistent, and there is no solution that satisfies all the conditions given in the problem. Thus, the question as stated is not solvable.  # There is no solution to this problem as the system of equations is inconsistent.",,1

He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 16 sacks per day and that each sack containes 57 oranges. How many days will it take to harvest 80 sacks of oranges?,5,"To find out how many days it will take to harvest 80 sacks of oranges, we first need to calculate the total number of oranges in 80 sacks.  Since each sack contains 57 oranges, the total number of oranges in 80 sacks is: $57 \times 80 = 4560$ oranges.  Now, if they harvest 16 sacks per day, the number of days it will take to harvest 80 sacks can be calculated by dividing the total number of oranges by the number of oranges harvested per day: $4560 \div (16 \times 57) = 5$ days.  Therefore, it will take 5 days to harvest 80 sacks of oranges.  # 5",,5

Therefore, the difference in the number of marbles Ed had compared to Doug after these events is $(x + 33) - (x - 27) = x + 33 - x + 27 = 60$.  So, Ed had 60 more marbles than Doug then.  # 60",,60
If the cave is 919 feet deep and they need to travel 1307 feet How far is the end of the cave?,2226,"To find the distance to the end of the cave, we need to subtract the distance they have already traveled from the total depth of the cave.  Total depth of the cave = 919 feet Distance they have traveled = 1307 feet  Distance to the end of the cave = Total depth of the cave - Distance they have traveled Distance to the end of the cave = 919 feet - 1307 feet  To find the distance to the end of the cave, we need to perform the subtraction:  919 - 1307 = -388  Therefore, the distance to the end of the cave is 388 feet.  # 388",,388

36 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 68 children got off the bus while some more got on the bus. Then there were 12 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got off the bus than those that got on?,24,"Let's denote the number of children that got on the bus as $x$.   Initially, there were 36 children on the bus. After 68 children got off and $x$ children got on, there were $36 - 68 + x = x - 32$ children on the bus.  Finally, there were 12 children on the bus, so we have the equation $x - 32 = 12$.  Solving for $x$, we get $x = 44$.  The number of children that got off the bus is $68$, and the number of children that got on the bus is $44$. Therefore, the difference is $68 - 44 = 24$.  #  24",,24

How many more cups of sugar than cups of salt does she need to add now?,1,"Mary needs to add 6 cups of flour, 8 cups of sugar, and 7 cups of salt to complete the recipe. She has already added 5 cups of flour, so she still needs to add 6 - 5 = 1 cup of flour.  To find out how many more cups of sugar than cups of salt she needs to add, we first calculate how many cups of sugar she needs to add. Since she already added 5 cups of flour, she still needs to add 8 - 5 = 3 cups of sugar.  Similarly, she still needs to add 7 cups of salt.  To find the difference between the cups of sugar and salt she needs to add, we calculate 3 - 7 = -4.  Therefore, Mary needs to add 4 more cups of salt than cups of sugar.  # -4",,4

In a school there are 635 girls and the rest are boys. If there are 510 more boys than girls How many boys are there in that school?,1145,"Let's denote the number of boys in the school as $b$.  From the given information, we know that there are 635 girls in the school. Since the rest are boys, the total number of students in the school is $635 + b$.  We are also given that there are 510 more boys than girls. This can be expressed as:  $b = 635 + 510$  Now we can solve for the number of boys in the school:  $b = 635 + 510$  $b = 1145$  Therefore, there are 1145 boys in the school.  #1145",,1145
Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 30 bottle caps and 14 wrappers at the park. Now he has 7 bottle caps and 86 wrappers in his collection. How many more bottle caps than wrappers did danny find at the park?,16,"Let's first find out how many more bottle caps and wrappers Danny found at the park compared to what he already had in his collection.  He found 30 bottle caps at the park and already had 7, so he found 30 - 7 = 23 more bottle caps at the park.  He found 14 wrappers at the park and already had 86, so he found 14 - 86 = -72 fewer wrappers at the park.  Now, let's find the difference between the number of bottle caps and wrappers Danny found at the park:  23 - (-72) = 23 + 72 = 95  Therefore, Danny found 95 more bottle caps than wrappers at the park.   # 95",,95

"The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 24 inches. The frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 5 inches lesser than the frog. How much farther did the mouse jump than the grasshopper?",28,"Let's first find out how far the frog and the mouse jumped.  The frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper, so its jump was $24 + 33 = 57$ inches.  The mouse jumped 5 inches lesser than the frog, so its jump was $57 - 5 = 52$ inches.  To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we need to calculate the difference between their jumps:  $52 - 24 = 28$ inches.  Therefore, the mouse jumped 28 inches farther than the grasshopper.  # 28",,28
Haley grew 13 trees in her backyard. After a typhoon 6 died. How many more trees survived the typhoon than those that died?,1,"To find out how many more trees survived the typhoon than those that died, we first need to calculate how many trees survived and how many died.  Haley grew 13 trees in her backyard. After the typhoon, 6 trees died.  Number of trees that survived = Total trees - Trees that died Number of trees that survived = 13 - 6 Number of trees that survived = 7  Now, to find out how many more trees survived than those that died: Number of trees that survived - Number of trees that died 7 - 6 = 1  Therefore, 1 more tree survived the typhoon than those that died.  # 1",,1
There are 8 different books and 10 different movies in the ' crazy silly school ' series. If you read 19 of the books and watched 61 of the movies How many more movies than books are there in the ' crazy silly school ' series?,2,"Let's denote the number of books as $B$ and the number of movies as $M$. We are given that $B = 8$ and $M = 10$.   If you read 19 of the books and watched 61 of the movies, we have $B_{\text{read}} = 19$ and $M_{\text{watched}} = 61$.  We want to find the difference between the number of movies and books, so we need to calculate $M_{\text{watched}} - B_{\text{read}}$.  $M_{\text{watched}} - B_{\text{read}} = 61 - 19 = 42$  Therefore, there are 42 more movies than books in the 'crazy silly school' series.  # 42",,42

Jake has 13 fewer peaches and 3 more apples than Steven. Steven has 9 peaches and 8 apples. How many apples does Jake have?,11,"Let's first find out how many apples Jake has.  Since Steven has 8 apples, Jake has 8 + 3 = 11 apples.  Now, let's find out how many peaches Jake has.  Since Jake has 13 fewer peaches than Steven, and Steven has 9 peaches, Jake has 9 - 13 = -4 peaches.  However, it doesn't make sense for Jake to have negative peaches, so there seems to be an error in the question. Let's correct it by assuming that Jake has 13 fewer peaches than Steven.  So, Jake has 9 - 13 = -4 peaches.  Again, it doesn't make sense for Jake to have negative peaches, so let's correct it by assuming that Jake has 13 fewer peaches than Steven.  Therefore, Jake has 9 - 13 = -4 peaches.  This is still not possible, so there seems to be a mistake in the question. Let's assume that Jake has 13 more peaches than Steven instead.  Therefore, Jake has 9 + 13 = 22 peaches.  So, Jake has 11 apples and 22 peaches.  # Jake has 11 apples.",,11
