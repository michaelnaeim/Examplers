Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 41 bird families living near the mountain. If 35 bird families flew away to asia and 62 bird families flew away to africa How many more bird families flew away to africa than those that flew away to asia?,27,"To find out how many more bird families flew away to Africa than those that flew away to Asia, we need to compare the number of bird families that flew to each location.  1. The number of bird families that flew away to Asia is 35. 2. The number of bird families that flew away to Africa is 62.  Now, we calculate the difference:  Number of bird families that flew to Africa - Number of bird families that flew to Asia = 62 - 35.  Calculating this gives us:  62 - 35 = 27.  Thus, there are 27 more bird families that flew away to Africa than those that flew away to Asia.  # 27",,27
Paige raised 7 goldfish and 12 catfish in the pond but stray cats loved eating them. Now she has 15 left. How many fishes disappeared?,4,"To find out how many fish disappeared, we first need to determine the total number of fish Paige originally had.

To find out how many fish disappeared, we subtract the number of fish left from the original total: \[  19 - 15 = 4  \]  Thus, the number of fish that disappeared is 4.  # 4",,4
Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Together they collected strawberries that weighed 22 pounds. On the way back Marco ' dad found 30 more pounds of strawberries. Marco's strawberries now weighed 36 pounds. How much did his dad's strawberries weigh now?,16,"To find out how much Marco's dad's strawberries weigh now, we can follow these steps:  1. Initially, Marco and his dad collected strawberries that weighed a total of 22 pounds. 2. On the way back, they found an additional 30 pounds of strawberries. 3. Marco's strawberries now weigh 36 pounds.  Let's denote the initial weight of Marco's dad's strawberries as \( D \).   From the initial collection, we have: \[ M + D = 22 \] where \( M \) is the weight of Marco's strawberries.  After finding the additional strawberries, the total weight of strawberries they have is: \[ M + D + 30 \]  Since we know Marco's strawberries now weigh 36 pounds, we can set up the equation: \[ 36 + D + 30 = M + D + 30 \]  Now, we can substitute \( M \) from the first equation into the second equation: From \( M + D = 22 \), we can express \( M \) as: \[ M = 22 - D \]  Substituting this into the total weight equation: \[ 36 + D + 30 = (22 - D) + D + 30 \]  This simplifies to: \[ 36 + D + 30 = 22 + 30 \] \[ 36 + D + 30 = 52 \]  Now, we can solve for \( D \): \[ D + 66 = 52 \] \[ D = 52 - 66 \] \[ D = -14 \]  This indicates that the initial weight of Marco's dad's strawberries was not directly needed to find the current weight. Instead, we can find the current weight of his dad's strawberries by considering the total weight after finding the additional strawberries.  The total weight of strawberries after finding the additional 30 pounds is: \[ 36 + D + 30 = 36 + (22 - M) + 30 \]  Since we know Marco's strawberries weigh 36 pounds, we can find the dad's strawberries: The total weight of strawberries now is: \[ 36 + 30 = 66 \]  Now, we can find the weight of Marco's dad's strawberries: \[ D + 30 = 66 - 36 \] \[ D + 30 = 30 \] \[ D = 30 - 30 \] \[ D = 0 \]  Thus, Marco's dad's strawberries weigh 30 pounds now.  So, the final answer is:  # 30",,30

Paige raised 16 goldfish and 71 catfish in the pond but stray cats loved eating them. Now she has 2 left. How many goldfish disappeared?,14,"To find out how many goldfish disappeared, we first need to determine the total number of fish Paige originally had.   Paige raised: - 16 goldfish - 71 catfish  The total number of fish she originally had is: 16 + 71 = 87 fish.  Now, we know that she has 2 fish left. Therefore, the number of fish that disappeared is: 87 - 2 = 85 fish.  Since we need to find out how many goldfish disappeared, we can denote the number of goldfish that disappeared as \( x \) and the number of catfish that disappeared as \( y \).   We know: 1. \( x + y = 85 \) (total fish that disappeared) 2. After the disappearance, she has 2 fish left, which means the remaining fish must be a combination of the remaining goldfish and catfish.  Since she started with 16 goldfish, the number of goldfish left is: 16 - \( x \).  Since she started with 71 catfish, the number of catfish left is: 71 - \( y \).  The total number of fish left is: (16 - \( x \)) + (71 - \( y \)) = 2.  This simplifies to: 87 - (x + y) = 2.  Substituting \( x + y = 85 \) into the equation gives: 87 - 85 = 2, which is consistent.  Now, we need to find out how many goldfish disappeared. Since we have no additional information about how many catfish disappeared, we can assume that all the remaining fish could be catfish.   If we assume that all 2 remaining fish are catfish, then: - All 16 goldfish could have disappeared, which means \( x = 16 \) and \( y = 69 \) (since 71 - 69 = 2).  Thus, the number of goldfish that disappeared is: 16.  Therefore, the final answer is:  # 16",,16

Substituting the value of \( S \): \[ F = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ cups of flour} \]  Now, we need to find out how many cups of flour Mary has already put in. Since she needs a total of 8 cups of flour and we don't have information about how much she has already added, we can denote the amount of flour she has already put in as \( x \).  Thus, the equation becomes: \[ x + \text{(additional flour needed)} = 8 \]  However, since we are not given the amount of flour she has already put in, we can conclude that she needs to put in enough flour to reach a total of 8 cups.  Therefore, the amount of flour she needs to add is: \[ F - x = 8 - x \]  But since we are asked how many cups of flour she put in, we can conclude that she has put in \( x \) cups of flour, where \( x \) is less than or equal to 8.  Since the problem does not specify how much flour she has already added, we can only conclude that she needs to add enough flour to reach a total of 8 cups.  Thus, the answer to how many cups of flour she put in is not determinable without additional information.

Let \( Z \) represent the number of push-ups Zachary did. According to the problem, we have:  \[ D = Z + 56 \]  where \( D \) is the number of push-ups David did. We know that David did 38 push-ups, so we can substitute that into the equation:  \[ 38 = Z + 56 \]  To find \( Z \), we can rearrange the equation:  \[ Z = 38 - 56 \] \[ Z = -18 \]  Since the number of push-ups cannot be negative, it seems there is a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem. However, if we consider the total push-ups done by both David and Zachary, we can calculate it as follows:  David did 38 push-ups, and Zachary did \( 38 - 56 = -18 \), which is not possible. Therefore, we can conclude that Zachary did 0 push-ups (as he cannot do a negative number of push-ups).

The dad found 30 more pounds of strawberries, so the new weight of his dad's strawberries can be calculated as follows:  1. The dad's initial weight of strawberries can be found from the equation:    \[ D = 22 - M \]  2. Since we don't know \( M \) yet, we can use the information that Marco's strawberries increased from \( M \) to 36 pounds. The increase in Marco's strawberries is:    \[ 36 - M \]  3. The dad found 30 more pounds of strawberries, so the new weight of his dad's strawberries is:    \[ D + 30 \]  Now, we can set up the equation: \[ D + 30 = (22 - M) + 30 \]  Since we know that Marco's strawberries increased to 36 pounds, we can substitute \( M \) with 36: \[ D + 30 = (22 - 36) + 30 \] \[ D + 30 = -14 + 30 \] \[ D + 30 = 16 \]  Thus, the weight of Marco's dad's strawberries now is: \[ D + 30 = 16 \]  So, the weight of his dad's strawberries is: \[ D = 16 - 30 \] \[ D = -14 \]  This indicates that we need to recalculate based on the initial total weight of strawberries collected.   Since Marco's strawberries weigh 36 pounds now, and the dad's strawberries were part of the original 22 pounds, we can conclude that the dad's strawberries must weigh: \[ 36 - 22 + 30 = 44 \]  Thus, the dad's strawberries now weigh: \[ 36 + 30 = 66 \]  Therefore, the final weight of Marco's dad's strawberries is: # 66",,66
Debby bought 200 water bottles and 256 soda bottles when they were on sale.

We know that Ed had 10 more marbles than Doug.     Let \( D \) be the number of marbles Doug had initially. Then we can express Ed's marbles as:    \[    E = D + 10    \]    Given that Ed had 45 marbles, we can set up the equation:    \[    D + 10 = 45    \]  2. Solving for \( D \):    \[    D = 45 - 10 = 35    \]    So, Doug initially had 35 marbles.  3. Now, we know that Doug lost 11 marbles:    \[    D_{\text{after}} = D - 11 = 35 - 11 = 24    \]    Therefore, after losing marbles, Doug has 24 marbles.  4. Now we need to find out how many more marbles Ed has than Doug after Doug lost his marbles:    \[    \text{Difference} = E - D_{\text{after}} = 45 - 24 = 21    \]  Thus, Ed has 21 more marbles than Doug after Doug lost some.  # 21",,21

Rebecca wants to split a collection of eggs into groups of 11. If each group has 2 eggs How many eggs does Rebecca have?,22,"To find out how many eggs Rebecca has, we need to determine the total number of eggs based on the information given.  Rebecca wants to split her collection of eggs into groups of 11, and each group has 2 eggs. This means that the total number of eggs can be calculated by multiplying the number of groups by the number of eggs in each group.  Let \( x \) be the number of groups. Since each group has 2 eggs, the total number of eggs \( E \) can be expressed as:  \[ E = 11 \times x \]  However, we also know that each group contains 2 eggs, so we can set up the equation:  \[ E = 2 \times x \]  To find the total number of eggs, we can equate the two expressions for \( E \):  \[ 11x = 2x \]  This equation does not make sense as it implies that \( 11 = 2 \), which is incorrect.   Instead, we can interpret the question as asking how many eggs Rebecca has if she can form groups of 11 with 2 eggs in each group.   If we assume that the total number of eggs is a multiple of 11, we can express the total number of eggs as:  \[ E = 11 \times k \]  where \( k \) is the number of groups. Since each group has 2 eggs, we can also express the total number of eggs as:  \[ E = 2 \times m \]  where \( m \) is the total number of eggs divided by 2.  To find a suitable value for \( E \), we can set \( k = 1 \) (the smallest number of groups):  \[ E = 11 \times 1 = 11 \]  This means that if Rebecca has 11 eggs, she can form 1 group of 11 eggs, but this does not satisfy the condition of having 2 eggs in each group.  If we set \( k = 2 \):  \[ E = 11 \times 2 = 22 \]  This means that if Rebecca has 22 eggs, she can form 2 groups of 11 eggs, but again, this does not satisfy the condition of having 2 eggs in each group.  Continuing this process, we can find that if \( k = 5 \):  \[ E = 11 \times 5 = 55 \]  This means that if Rebecca has 55 eggs, she can form 5 groups of 11 eggs, and since each group has 2 eggs, this would not be correct.  To summarize, the question seems to be asking for a total number of eggs that can be divided into groups of 11, but the condition of having 2 eggs in each group is not clear.  If we assume that the total number of eggs must be a multiple of both 11 and 2, we can find the least common multiple (LCM) of 11 and 2, which is 22.  Thus, the total number of eggs Rebecca has is:  \[ E = 22 \]  Therefore, the final answer is:  # 22",,22

Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar and 10 cups of flour. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar How many cups of flour did she put in?,2,"To find out how many cups of flour Mary has already put in, we can set up the following equation based on the information given:  Let \( x \) be the number of cups of flour Mary has already put in.  According to the problem, she needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar. Since the recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar, the total amount of flour needed is:  \[ 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ cups of flour} \]  Now, we know that the total amount of flour needed is 10 cups. Therefore, the amount of flour she has already put in can be calculated as follows:  \[ x + (10 - x) = 10 \]  However, we also know that she needs 8 cups of flour in total. Thus, we can set up the equation:  \[ x = 8 \]  This means that Mary has already put in:  \[ 10 - 8 = 2 \text{ cups of flour} \]  Thus, the number of cups of flour she has already put in is:  \[ x = 10 - 5 = 5 \]  So, the final answer is:  # 5",,5

David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary in gym class today. If David did 38 push-ups How many push-ups did Zachary and David do altogether?,20,"To find out how many push-ups Zachary did, we first need to determine the number of push-ups he did based on the information given.  David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary. We can express this relationship mathematically as:  \[  \text{David's push-ups} = \text{Zachary's push-ups} + 56  \]  We know that David did 38 push-ups. Therefore, we can set up the equation:  \[  38 = \text{Zachary's push-ups} + 56  \]  To find Zachary's push-ups, we can rearrange the equation:  \[  \text{Zachary's push-ups} = 38 - 56  \]  Calculating this gives:  \[  \text{Zachary's push-ups} = -18  \]  Since the number of push-ups cannot be negative, we need to correct our understanding. The correct interpretation is that if David did 38 push-ups, then Zachary did:  \[  \text{Zachary's push-ups} = 38 - 56 = -18  \]  This indicates that the initial assumption about the relationship was incorrect. Instead, we should consider that David's push-ups are more than Zachary's, and we need to find the total push-ups done by both.  If David did 38 push-ups, then Zachary did:  \[  \text{Zachary's push-ups} = 38 - 56 = -18  \]  This is not possible, so we need to re-evaluate the problem.   If David did 38 push-ups, and he did 56 more than Zachary, then Zachary must have done:  \[  \text{Zachary's push-ups} = 38 - 56 = -18  \]  This indicates that the problem is not set up correctly.   However, if we consider the total push-ups done by both David and Zachary, we can calculate:  Total push-ups = David's push-ups + Zachary's push-ups  Since we have established that David did 38 push-ups, and Zachary did 38 - 56 = -18, we can conclude that the total push-ups done by both is:  Total = 38 + (38 - 56) = 38 + (-18) = 20  Thus, the total number of push-ups done by both David and Zachary is:  # 20",,20

Thus, the mouse's jump is:    \[    \text{Mouse's jump} = \text{Frog's jump} - 5 = 57 - 5 = 52 \text{ inches}    \]  4. **Difference between the mouse's jump and the grasshopper's jump**: We need to find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper:    \[    \text{Difference} = \text{Mouse's jump} - \text{Grasshopper's jump} = 52 - 24 = 28 \text{ inches}    \]  Thus, the mouse jumped 28 inches farther than the grasshopper.  # 28",,28
Haley grew 13 trees in her backyard. After a typhoon 6 died. How many more trees survived the typhoon than those that died?,1,"To find out how many more trees survived the typhoon than those that died, we first need to determine how many trees survived.  1. Haley initially grew 13 trees. 2. After the typhoon, 6 trees died.  To find the number of trees that survived, we subtract the number of trees that died from the total number of trees:  Survived = Total trees - Died Survived = 13 - 6 = 7  Now, we need to find out how many more trees survived than those that died:  More survived = Survived - Died More survived = 7 - 6 = 1  Thus, the number of more trees that survived than those that died is 1.  # 1",,1

Faye was placing her pencils into rows with 22 pencils in each row. She had 6 packs of pencils each one having 14 pencils. How many pencils does she have?,84,"To find out how many pencils Faye has, we first need to calculate the total number of pencils she has from the packs.  Faye has 6 packs of pencils, and each pack contains 14 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils can be calculated as follows:  \[ \text{Total pencils} = \text{Number of packs} \times \text{Pencils per pack} = 6 \times 14 \]  Calculating this gives:  \[ 6 \times 14 = 84 \]  Thus, Faye has a total of 84 pencils.  # 84",,84
White t - shirts can be purchased in packages. If mom buys 66 white t - shirts where each package has 3 white t - shirts. How many packages will she have?,22,"To find out how many packages of white t-shirts mom will have, we need to divide the total number of t-shirts by the number of t-shirts in each package.  Given: - Total white t-shirts = 66 - T-shirts per package = 3  We perform the division:  \[ \text{Number of packages} = \frac{\text{Total white t-shirts}}{\text{T-shirts per package}} = \frac{66}{3} = 22 \]  Thus, mom will have 22 packages of white t-shirts.  # 22",,22
Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 5 cups of sugar and 13 cups of flour. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 12 more cups of flour How many cups of flour did she put in?,1,"To find out how many cups of flour Mary has already put in, we can set up the equation based on the information given.  The recipe calls for a total of 13 cups of flour. Mary still needs 12 more cups of flour. Therefore, we can calculate how much flour she has already added by subtracting the amount she still needs from the total required:  Total flour needed = 13 cups   Flour still needed = 12 cups    Flour already put in = Total flour needed - Flour still needed   Flour already put in = 13 cups - 12 cups   Flour already put in = 1 cup    Thus, Mary has put in 1 cup of flour.  # 1",,1
"7 red peaches, 15 yellow peaches and 8 green peaches are in the basket.

Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost some of his marbles at the playground. Now Ed has 19 more marbles than doug. How many marbles did Doug lose?,17,"Let the number of marbles Doug originally had be \( d \). According to the problem, Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug, so we can express Ed's marbles as:  \[ e = d + 2 \]  After Doug lost some marbles, let’s denote the number of marbles Doug lost as \( x \). Therefore, the number of marbles Doug has now is:  \[ d - x \]  At this point, we know that Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug, which gives us the equation:  \[ e = (d - x) + 19 \]  Substituting the expression for \( e \) from the first equation into this equation, we have:  \[ d + 2 = (d - x) + 19 \]  Now, we can simplify this equation:  \[ d + 2 = d - x + 19 \]  Subtract \( d \) from both sides:  \[ 2 = -x + 19 \]  Now, add \( x \) to both sides and subtract 2 from both sides:  \[ x = 19 - 2 \]  Thus, we find:  \[ x = 17 \]  This means Doug lost 17 marbles.  # 17",,17
Dan has $ 3 left with him after he bought a candy bar for $ 2. How much money did he have initially?,5,"To find out how much money Dan had initially, we can set up the equation based on the information given.  Let \( x \) be the amount of money Dan had initially.  According to the problem, after buying a candy bar for $2, he has $3 left. Therefore, we can write the equation:  \[ x - 2 = 3 \]  Now, we will solve for \( x \):  1. Add 2 to both sides of the equation:  \[ x = 3 + 2 \]  2. Simplify the right side:  \[ x = 5 \]  Thus, Dan had $5 initially.  # 5",,5
Jake has 13 fewer peaches and 3 more apples than Steven. Steven has 9 peaches and 8 apples. How many apples does Jake have?,11,"To find out how many apples Jake has, we first need to determine how many peaches and apples Steven has.  From the problem, we know: - Steven has 9 peaches and 8 apples.  Now, we can calculate how many peaches Jake has: - Jake has 13 fewer peaches than Steven. - Therefore, the number of peaches Jake has is:   \[   \text{Jake's peaches} = \text{Steven's peaches} - 13 = 9 - 13 = -4   \] This indicates that Jake cannot have a negative number of peaches, which suggests that the phrasing of the problem might imply that Jake has 0 peaches instead.  Next, we calculate how many apples Jake has: - Jake has 3 more apples than Steven. - Therefore, the number of apples Jake has is:   \[   \text{Jake's apples} = \text{Steven's apples} + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11   \]  Thus, the final answer is:  # 11",,11
